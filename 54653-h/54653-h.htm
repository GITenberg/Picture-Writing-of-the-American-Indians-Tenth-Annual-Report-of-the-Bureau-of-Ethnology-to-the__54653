<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Research among the North American Indians, in obedience
to acts of Congress, was continued during the fiscal year
1888-’89.</p>

<p>The explanation presented in several former annual reports
of the general plan upon which the work of the Bureau has
been performed renders a detailed repetition superfluous. The
lines of investigation which from time to time have appeared
to be the most useful or the most pressing have been confided
to persons trained in or known to be specially adapted to their
pursuit. The results of their labors are presented in the three
series of publications of the Bureau which are provided for
by law. A brief statement of the work upon which each one
of the special students was actively engaged during the fiscal
year is furnished below; but it should be noted that this statement
does not specify all the studies made or services rendered
by them.</p>

<p>The assistance of explorers, writers, and students who are
not and may not desire to be officially connected with the Bureau
is again invited. Their contributions, whether in suggestions
or extended communications, will always be gratefully
acknowledged and will receive proper credit. They may be
published as Congress will allow, either in the series of annual
reports or in monographs or bulletins. Several valuable papers
of this class have already been contributed and published.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex" id="pagex">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>The report now submitted consists of three principal divisions.
The first relates to the publications made during the
fiscal year; the second, to the work prosecuted in the field;
the third, to the office work, which chiefly consists of the preparation
for publication of the results of field work, with the
corrections and additions obtained from exhaustive researches
into the literature of the subjects discussed and by correspondence
relative to them.</p>


<h3>PUBLICATIONS.</h3>

<p>The publications actually issued and distributed during the
year were as follows, all octavo:</p>

<p>Bibliography of the Iroquoian Languages, by James C. Pilling;
pages i-vi + 1-208. Facsimile reproductions, at pages
44 and 56, of title pages of early publications relating to Indian
languages, and, at page 72, of the Cherokee alphabet.</p>

<p>Textile Fabrics of Ancient Peru, by William H. Holmes;
pages 1-17, Figs. 1-11.</p>

<p>The Problem of the Ohio Mounds, by Cyrus Thomas; pages
1-54, Figs. 1-8.</p>


<h3>FIELD WORK.</h3>

<p>The field work of the year is divided into (1) mound explorations
and (2) general field studies, the latter being directed
chiefly to archeology, linguistics, and pictography.</p>


<h4>MOUND EXPLORATIONS.</h4>


<h5>WORK OF MR. CYRUS THOMAS.</h5>

<p>The work of exploring the mounds of the eastern United
States was, as in former years, under the superintendence of
Mr. Cyrus Thomas. The efforts of the division were chiefly
confined to the examination of material already collected and
to the arrangement and preparation for publication of the data
on hand. Field work received less attention, therefore, than
in previous years, and was mainly directed to such investigations
as were necessary to elucidate doubtful points and to
the examination and surveys of important works which had
not before received adequate attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi" id="pagexi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>The only assistants to Mr. Thomas whose engagements
embraced the entire year were Mr. James D. Middleton and
Mr. Henry L. Reynolds. Mr. Gerard Fowke, one of the assistants,
ceased his connection with the Bureau at the end of
the second month. Mr. John W. Emmert was engaged as a
temporary assistant for a few months.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. GERARD FOWKE.</h5>

<p>During the short time in which he remained with the division,
Mr. Fowke was engaged in exploring certain mounds in the
Sciota valley, Ohio, a field to which Messrs. Squier and Davis
had devoted much attention. Its reexamination was for the
purpose of investigating certain typical mounds which had not
been thoroughly examined by those explorers.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. J. D. MIDDLETON.</h5>

<p>Mr. Middleton was employed from July to the latter part of
October in the exploration of mounds and other ancient works
in Calhoun county, Illinois, a territory to which special interest
attaches because it seems to be on the border line of different
archeologic districts. From October until December he
was engaged at Washington in preparing plats of Ohio earthworks.
During the next month he made resurveys of some of
the more important inclosures in Ohio, after which he resumed
work in the office at Washington until the latter part of March,
when he was sent to Tennessee to examine several mound
groups and to determine, so far as possible, the exact locations
of the old Cherokee “over-hill towns.” The result of the last-mentioned
investigation was valuable, as it indicated that each
of these “over-hill towns” was, with possibly one unimportant
exception, in the locality of a mound group.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. H. L. REYNOLDS.</h5>

<p>Near the close of October Mr. Reynolds, having already examined
the inclosures of the northern, eastern, and western
sections of the mound region, went to Ohio and West Virginia
to study the different types found there, with reference to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexii" id="pagexii">[xii]</a></span>
chapters he was preparing on the various forms of ancient inclosures
in the United States. While thus engaged he explored
a large mound connected with one of the typical works
in Paint creek valley, obtaining unexpected and important results.
The construction of this tumulus was found to be quite
different from most of those in the same section examined by
Messrs. Squier and Davis.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. J. W. EMMERT.</h5>

<p>Mr. Emmert devoted the few months in which he was employed
to the successful exploration of mounds in eastern
Tennessee. Some important discoveries were made and additional
interesting facts were ascertained in regard to the mounds
of that section.</p>


<h4>GENERAL FIELD STUDIES.</h4>


<h5>WORK OF COL. GARRICK MALLERY.</h5>

<p>Early in the month of July Col. Garrick Mallery proceeded
to Maine, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to continue investigation
into the pictographs of the Abnaki and Micmac Indians,
which had been commenced in 1887. He first visited rocks in
Maine, on the shore near Machiasport, and on Hog island, in
Holmes bay, a part of Machias bay. In both localities pecked
petroglyphs were found, accurate copies of which were taken.
Some of them had not before been reported. They are probably
of Abnaki origin, of either the Penobscot or the Passamaquoddy
division, the rocks lying on the line of water communication
between the territories of those divisions. From Maine
he proceeded to Kejemkoojik lake, on the border of Queens
and Annapolis counties, Nova Scotia, and resumed the work
of drawing and tracing the large number of petroglyphs found
during the previous summer. Perfect copies were obtained of
so many of them as to be amply sufficient for study and comparison.
These are incised petroglyphs, and were made by
Micmacs. The country of the Malecites, on the St. Johns river,
New Brunswick, was next visited. No petroglyphs were discovered,
but a considerable amount of information was obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii" id="pagexiii">[xiii]</a></span>
upon the old system of pictographs on birch bark and
its use. Illustrative specimens were gathered, together with
myths and legends, which assisted in the elucidation of some
of the pictographs observed elsewhere.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. W. J. HOFFMAN.</h5>

<p>Mr. W. J. Hoffman proceeded in July to visit the Red Lake
and White Earth Indian reservations in Minnesota. At Red
lake he obtained copies of birch bark records pertaining to the
Midē'wiwin or Grand Medicine Society of the Ojibwa, an order
of shamans professing the power to prophesy, to cure disease,
and to confer success in the chase. The introductory portion
of the ritual of this society pertains particularly to the Ojibwa
cosmogony. At the same place he secured several birch bark
records of hunting expeditions, battles with neighboring tribes
of Indians, maps, and songs. He also investigated the former
and present practice of tattooing, and the Ojibwa works of art
in colors, beads, and quills.</p>

<p>At White Earth Reservation two distinct charts of the Grand
Medicine Society were obtained, together with full explanations
by two of the chief midé or shamans, one of whom was the
only fourth-degree priest in either of the reservations. Although
a considerable difference between these three charts is apparent,
their principles and the general course of the initiation
of the candidates are similar. The survival of archaic forms
in the charts and ritual indicates a considerable antiquity.
Some mnemonic songs were also obtained at this reservation.
In addition to the ritual, secured directly from the
priests, in the Ojibwa language, translations of the songs
were also recorded, with musical notation. On leaving the
above reservations, Mr. Hoffman proceeded to Pipestone, Minnesota,
to copy the petroglyphs upon the cliffs of that historic
quarry.</p>

<p>He then returned to St. Paul, Minnesota, to search the
records of the library of the Minnesota Historical Society for
copies of pictographs reported to have been made near La
Pointe, Wisconsin. Little information was obtained, although
it is known that such pictographs, now nearly obliterated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiv" id="pagexiv">[xiv]</a></span>
existed upon conspicuous cliffs and rocks near Lake Superior,
at and in the vicinity of Bayfield and Ashland.</p>

<p>Mr. Hoffman afterward made an examination of the “pictured
cave,” eight miles northeast of La Crosse, Wisconsin, to
obtain copies of the characters appearing there. These are rapidly
being destroyed by the disintegration of the rock. The
colors employed in delineating the various figures were dark
red and black. The figures represent human beings, deer, and
other forms not now distinguishable.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. H. W. HENSHAW.</h5>

<p>Mr. H. W. Henshaw spent the months of August, September,
and October on the Pacific coast, engaged in the collection
of vocabularies of several Indian languages, with a view
to their study and classification. The Umatilla Reservation
in Oregon was first visited with the object of obtaining a comprehensive
vocabulary of the Cayuse. Though there are
about four hundred of these Indians on the reservation, probably
not more than six speak the Cayuse tongue. The Cayuse
have extensively intermarried with the Umatilla, and now
speak the language of the latter, or that of the Nez Percé. An
excellent Cayuse vocabulary was obtained, and at the same
time the opportunity was embraced to secure vocabularies of
the Umatilla and the Nez Percé languages. His next objective
point was the neighborhood of the San Rafael Mission,
Marin county, California, the hope being entertained that some
of the Indians formerly gathered at the mission would be found
there. He learned that there were no Indians at or near
San Rafael, but subsequently found a few on the shores of
Tomales bay, to the north. A good vocabulary was collected
from one of these, which, as was expected, was subsequently
found to be related to the Moquelumnan family of the interior,
to the southeast of San Francisco bay. Later the missions of
Santa Cruz and Monterey were visited. At these points there
still remain a few old Indians who retain a certain command
of their own language, though Spanish forms their ordinary
means of intercourse. The vocabularies obtained are sufficient
to prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that there are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexv" id="pagexv">[xv]</a></span>
linguistic families instead of one, as had been formerly supposed,
in the country above referred to. A still more important
discovery was made by Mr. Henshaw at Monterey, where
an old woman was found who succeeded in calling to mind
more than one hundred words and short phrases of the Esselen
language, formerly spoken near Monterey, but less than forty
words of which had been previously known. Near the town
of Cayucas, to the south, an aged and blind Indian was visited
who was able to add somewhat to the stock of Esselen words
obtained at Monterey, and to give valuable information concerning
the original home of that tribe. As a result of the
study of this material Mr. Henshaw determines the Esselen to
be a distinct linguistic family, a conclusion first drawn by Mr.
Curtin from a study of the vocabularies collected by Galiano
and Lamanon in the eighteenth century. The territory occupied
by the tribe and linguistic family lies coastwise, south of
Monterey bay, as far as the Santa Lucia mountains.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. JAMES MOONEY.</h5>

<p>On July 5 Mr. James Mooney started on a second trip to the
territory of the Cherokee in North Carolina, returning after an
absence of about four months. During this time he made considerable
additions to the linguistic material already obtained
by him, and was able to demonstrate the former existence of
a fourth, and perhaps even of a fifth, well-marked Cherokee dialect
in addition to the upper, lower, and middle dialects already
known. The invention of a Cherokee syllabary which was
adapted to the sounds of the upper dialect has tended to make
that dialect universal. A number of myths were collected,
together with a large amount of miscellaneous material relating
to the Cherokee tribe, and the great tribal game of ball
play, with its attendant ceremonies of dancing, conjuring,
scratching the bodies of the players, and going to water, was
witnessed. A camera was utilized to secure characteristic
pictures of the players. Special attention was given to the
subject of Indian medicine, theoretic, ceremonial, and therapeutic.
The most noted doctors of the tribe were employed
as informants, and nearly five hundred specimens of medicinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvi" id="pagexvi">[xvi]</a></span>
and food plants were collected and their Indian names and
uses ascertained. The general result of this investigation
shows that the medical and botanical knowledge of the Indians
has been greatly overrated. A study was made of Cherokee
personal names, about five hundred of which were translated,
being all the names of Indian origin now remaining in that
region. The most important results of Mr. Mooney’s investigations
were the discovery of a large number of manuscripts
containing the sacred formulas of the tribe, written in Cherokee
characters by the shamans for their own secret use, and jealously
guarded from the knowledge of all but the initiated.
The existence of such manuscripts had been ascertained during
a visit in 1887, and several of them had been procured. This
discovery of genuine aboriginal material, written in an Indian
language by shamans for their own use, is believed to be unique
in the history of aboriginal investigation, and was only made
possible through the invention of the Cherokee syllabary by
Sequoia in 1821. Every effort was made by Mr. Mooney to
obtain all the existing manuscripts, with the result of securing
all of that material which was in the possession of the tribe.
The whole number of formulas obtained is about six hundred.
They consist of prayers and sacred songs, explanations of ceremonies,
directions for medical treatment, and underlying theories.
They relate to medicine, love, war, hunting, fishing, self-protection,
witchcraft, agriculture, the ball play, and other
similar subjects, thus forming a complete exposition of an aboriginal
religion as set forth by its priests in their own language.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. JEREMIAH CURTIN.</h5>

<p>Early in October Mr. Jeremiah Curtin left Washington for
the Pacific coast. During the remainder of the year he was
occupied in Shasta and Humboldt counties, California, in collecting
vocabularies and data connected with the Indian system
of medicine. This work was continued in different parts of
Humboldt and Siskiyou counties until June 30, 1889. Large
collections of linguistic and other data were gathered and
myths were secured which show that the whole system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvii" id="pagexvii">[xvii]</a></span>
medicine of these Indians and the ministration of remedies
originated in and are limited to sorcery practices.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. A. S. GATSCHET.</h5>

<p>The field work of Mr. Albert S. Gatschet during the year
was short. It had been ascertained that Mrs. Alice M. Oliver,
now in Lynn, Massachusetts, formerly lived on Trespalacios
bay, Texas, near the homes of the Karánkawa, and Mr.
Gatschet visited Lynn with a view of securing as complete a
vocabulary as possible of their extinct language. Mrs. Oliver
was able to recall about one hundred and sixty terms of the
language, together with some phrases and sentences. She also
furnished many valuable details regarding the ethnography
of the tribe. Ten days were spent in this work.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. J. N. B. HEWITT.</h5>

<p>Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was occupied in field work from August
1 to November 8, as follows: From the first of August to
September 20 he was on the Tuscarora reserve, in Niagara
county, New York, in which locality fifty-five legends and
myths were collected. A Penobscot vocabulary was also obtained
here, together with other linguistic material. From
September 20 to November 8 Mr. Hewitt visited the Grand
River reserve, Canada, where a large amount of text was obtained,
together with notes and other linguistic material.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. VICTOR MINDELEFF.</h5>

<p>Mr. Victor Mindeleff left Washington on October 23 for St.
John’s, Arizona, where he examined the Hubbell collection of
ancient pottery and secured a series of photographs and colored
drawings of the more important specimens. Thence he
went to Zuñi and obtained drawings of interior details of
dwellings and other data necessary for the completion of his
studies of the architecture of this pueblo. He returned to
Washington December 7.</p>


<h5>WORK OF MR. A. M. STEPHEN.</h5>

<p>Mr. A. M. Stephen continued work among the Tusayan pueblos
under the direction of Mr. Victor Mindeleff. He added<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexviii" id="pagexviii">[xviii]</a></span>
much to the knowledge of the traditionary history of Tusayan,
and made an extensive study of the house lore and records of
house-building ceremonials. He also reported a full nomenclature
of Tusayan architectural terms as applied to the various
details of terraced-house construction, with etymologies.
He secured from the Navajo much useful information of the
ceremonial connected with the construction of their conical
lodges or “hogans,” supplementing the more purely architectural
records of their construction previously collected by Mr.
Mindeleff. As opportunity occurred he gathered typical collections
of baskets and other textile fabrics illustrative of the
successive stages of their manufacture, including specimens of
raw materials and detailed descriptions of the dyes used.
These collections are intended to include also the principal
patterns in use at the present time, with the Indian explanations
of their significance.</p>


<h3>OFFICE WORK.</h3>

<p>Major <span class="smcap">J. W. Powell</span>, the Director, devoted much time during
the year to the preparation of the paper to accompany a
map of the linguistic families of America north of Mexico, the
scope of which has been alluded to in previous reports. This
report and map appear in the Seventh Annual Report of the
Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henshaw</span> was chiefly occupied with the administrative
duties of the office, which have been placed in his charge by
the Director, and with the completion of the linguistic map.</p>

<p>Col. <span class="smcap">Mallery</span>, after his return from the field work elsewhere
mentioned, was engaged in the elaboration of the new information
obtained and in further continued study of and correspondence
relating to sign language and pictography. In this
work he was assisted by Mr. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>, particularly in the
sketches made by the latter during previous field seasons, and
in preparing a large number of the illustrations for the paper
on Picture-writing of the American Indians which appears in
the present volume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">J. Owen Dorsey</span> did no field work during the year, but
devoted much of the time to original investigations. Samuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexix" id="pagexix">[xix]</a></span>
Fremont, an Omaha Indian, came to Washington in October,
1888, and until February, 1889, assisted Mr. Dorsey in the revision
of the entries for the Ȼegiha-English Dictionary. Similar
assistance was rendered by Little Standing Buffalo, a Ponka
Indian from the Indian Territory, in April and May, 1889.
Mr. Dorsey also completed the entries for the Ȼegiha-English
Dictionary, and a list of Ponka, Omaha, and Winnebago personal
names. He translated from the Teton dialect of the
Dakota all the material of the Bushotter collection in the Bureau
of Ethnology, and prepared therefrom a paper on Teton
folklore. He also prepared a brief paper on the camping
circles of Siouan tribes, and in addition furnished an article on
the modes of predication in the Athapascan dialects of Oregon
and in several dialects of the Siouan family. He also edited
the manuscript of the Dakota grammar, texts, and ethnography,
written by the late Rev. Dr. S. R. Riggs, which has been published
as Volume <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span>, Contributions to North American Ethnology.
In May, 1889, he began an extensive paper on Indian
personal names, based on material obtained by himself in the
field, to contain names of the following tribes, viz: Omaha and
Ponka, Kansa, Osage, Kwapa, Iowa, Oto and Missouri, and
Winnebago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Albert S. Gatschet’s</span> office work was almost entirely
restricted to the composition and completion of his Ethnographic
Sketch, Grammar, and Dictionary of the Klamath
Language of Oregon, with the necessary appendices. These
works have been published as Parts 1 and 2, Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>, of Contributions
to North American Ethnology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jeremiah Curtin</span> during the year arranged and copied
myths of various Indian families, and also transcribed Wasco,
Sahaptin, and Yanan vocabularies previously collected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">James Mooney</span>, on his return from the Cherokee reservation
in 1888, began at once to translate a number of the prayers
and sacred songs obtained from the shamans during his visit.
The result of this work has appeared in a paper in the Seventh
Annual Report of the Bureau entitled “Sacred formulas of the
Cherokees.” Considerable time was devoted also to the elaboration
of the botanic and linguistic notes obtained in the field. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexx" id="pagexx">[xx]</a></span>
the spring of 1889 he began the collection of material for a
monograph on the aborigines of the Middle Atlantic slope, with
special reference to the Powhatan tribes of Virginia. As a
preliminary, about one thousand circulars, requesting information
in regard to local names, antiquities, and surviving
Indians, were distributed throughout Maryland, Delaware,
Virginia, and northeastern Carolina. Sufficient information
was obtained in responses to afford an excellent basis for future
work in this direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">John N. B. Hewitt</span>, from July 1 to August 1, was engaged
in arranging alphabetically the recorded words of the
Tuscarora-English dictionary mentioned in former reports, and
in the study of adjective word forms to determine the variety
and kind of the Tuscarora moods and tenses. After his return
from the field Mr. Hewitt classified and tabulated all the forms
of the personal pronouns employed in the Tuscarora language.
Studies were also prosecuted to develop the predicative function
in the Tuscarora speech. All the terms of consanguinity
and affinity as now used among the Tuscarora were recorded
and tabulated. Literal translations of many myths collected
in the field were made, and free translations added to four of
them. In all appropriate instances linguistic notes were added
relating to etymology, phonesis, and verbal change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">James C. Pilling</span> gave much time to bibliographies of
North American languages. The bibliography of the Iroquoian
languages was completed early in the fiscal year, and
the edition was issued in February. In the meantime a bibliography
of the Muskhogean languages was compiled, the
manuscript of which was sent to the Public Printer in January,
1889, though the edition was not delivered during the
fiscal year. Early in March, 1889, Mr. Pilling went to Philadelphia
to inspect the manuscripts belonging to the American
Philosophical Society, the authorities of which gave him every
facility, and much new material was secured. In June he
visited the Astor, Lenox, and Historical Society libraries in
New York; the libraries of the Boston Athenæum, Massachusetts
Historical Society, American Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Missions, and the Boston Public Library, in Boston;<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxi" id="pagexxi">[xxi]</a></span>
that of Harvard University, in Cambridge; of the American
Antiquarian Society, in Worcester; and the private library of
Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, in Hartford. In Canada he visited
the library of Laval University, and the private library of Mr.
P. Gagnon, in Quebec, of St. Mary’s College and Jacques
Cartier School in Montreal, and various missions along the St.
Lawrence river, to inspect the manuscripts left by the early
missionaries. The result was the accumulation of much new
material for insertion in the Algonquian bibliography.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">William H. Holmes</span> continued to edit the illustrations
for the publications of the Bureau, and besides was engaged
actively in his studies of aboriginal archeology. He completed
papers upon the pottery of the Potomac valley, and
upon the objects of shell collected by the Bureau during the
last eight years, and he has others in preparation. As curator
of Bureau collections he makes the following statement of
accessions for the year: From Mr. Thomas and his immediate
assistants, working in the mound region of the Mississippi
valley and contiguous portions of the Atlantic slope, the
Bureau has received one hundred and forty-six specimens,
including articles of clay, stone, shell, and bone. Mr. Victor
Mindeleff obtained sixteen specimens of pottery from the
Pueblo country. Other collections by members of the Bureau
and the U. S. Geological Survey are as follows: Shell beads
and pendants (modern) from San Buenaventura, California, by
Mr. Henshaw; fragments of pottery and other articles from
the vicinity of the Cheroki agency, North Carolina, by Mr.
Mooney; a large grooved hammer from the bluff at Three
Forks, Montana, by Mr. A. C. Peale; a large series of rude
stone implements from the District of Columbia, by Mr. De
Lancey W. Gill. Donations have been received as follows:
An important series of earthen vases from a mound on Perdido
bay, Alabama, given by F. H. Parsons; ancient pueblo vases
from southwestern Colorado, by William M. Davidson; a
series of spurious earthen vessels, manufactured by unknown
persons in eastern Iowa, from C. C. Jones, of Augusta, Georgia;
fragments of pottery, etc., from Romney, West Virginia, given
by G. H. Johnson; fragments of a steatite pot from Ledyard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxii" id="pagexxii">[xxii]</a></span>
Connecticut, by G. L. Fancher; an interesting series of stone
tools, earthen vessels, etc., from a mound on Lake Apopka,
Florida, by Thomas Featherstonhaugh; fragments of gilded
earthenware and photographs of antiquities from Mexico, by
F. Plancarte; fragments of gold ornaments from Costa Rica,
by Anastasio Alfaro. Important specimens have been received
as follows: Articles of clay from a mound on Perdido
bay, Alabama, loaned by Mrs. A. T. Mosman; articles of
clay from the last mentioned locality, by A. B. Simons; pottery
from the Potomac valley, by W. Hallett Phillips, by S.
V. Proudfit, and by H. L. Reynolds; articles of gold and
gold-copper alloy from Costa Rica, by Anastasio Alfaro, Secretary
of the National Museum at San Jose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> was chiefly occupied during the year in the
preparation of the second and third volumes of his reports
upon the mounds. He also prepared a bulletin on the Circular,
Square, and Octagonal Earthworks of Ohio, with a view
of giving a summary of the recent survey by the mound division
of the principal works of the above character in southern
Ohio. A second bulletin was completed, entitled “The Problem
of the Ohio Mounds,” in which he presented evidence to
show that the ancient works of the state are due to Indians of
several different tribes, and that some, at least, of the typical
works were built by the ancestors of the modern Cherokees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reynolds</span> after his return from the field was engaged in
the preparation of a general map of the United States, showing
the area of the mounds and the relative frequency of their
occurrence. He also assisted Mr. Thomas in the preparation
of the monograph upon the inclosures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Victor Mindeleff</span>, assisted by Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff,
was engaged in preparing for publication a “Study of Pueblo
Architecture” as illustrated in the provinces of Tusayan and
Cibola, material for which he had been collecting for a number
of years. This report has appeared in the Eighth Annual
Report of the Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cosmos Mindeleff</span> with the force of the modeling room
at the beginning of the fiscal year completed the exhibit of the
Bureau for the Cincinnati Exposition, and during the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiii" id="pagexxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
part of the year he was at Cincinnati in charge of that exhibit.
Owing to restricted space it was limited to the Pueblo culture
group, but this was illustrated as fully as the time would permit.
The exhibit covered about 1,200 feet of floor space, as
well as a large amount of wall space, and consisted of models
of pueblo and cliff ruins, models of inhabited pueblos, ancient
and modern pottery, examples of weaving, basketry, etc.; a
representative series of implements of war, the chase, agriculture,
and the household; manikins illustrating costumes,
and a series of large photographs illustrative of aboriginal
architecture of the pueblo region, and of many phases of
pueblo life. Upon Mr. Mindeleff’s return from Cincinnati he
resumed assistance to Mr. Victor Mindeleff upon the report on
pueblo architecture, and by the close of the fiscal year the two
chapters which had been assigned to him were completed.
They consist of a review of the literature on the pueblo region
and a summary of the traditions of the Tusayan group from
material collected by Mr. A. M. Stephen. Work was also continued
on the duplicate series of models, and twelve were
advanced to various stages of completion. Some time was
devoted to repairing original models which had been exhibited
at Cincinnati and other exhibitions, and also to experiments
in casting in paper, in order in find a suitable paper for use
in large models. The experiments were successful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">J. K. Hillers</span> has continued the collection of photographs
of prominent Indians in both full-face and profile, by
which method all the facial characteristics are exhibited to the
best advantage. In nearly every instance a record has been
preserved of the sitter’s status in the tribe, his age, biographic
notes of interest, and in cases of mixed bloods, the degree of
intermixture of blood. The total number of photographs obtained
during the year is 27, distributed among the following
tribes, viz: Sac and Fox, 5; Dakota, 6; Omaha, 6, and mixed
bloods (Creeks), 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Franz Boas</span> was employed from February to April in
preparing for convenient use a series of vocabularies of the
several Salish divisions, previously collected by him in British
Columbia.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiv" id="pagexxiv">[xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lucien M. Turner</span> was for two years stationed at the
Hudson Bay Company’s post, Fort Chimo, near the northern
end of the peninsula of Labrador, as a civilian observer in the
employ of the Signal Service, U. S. Army. He was appointed
to that position at the request of the late Prof. Baird, Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, in order that his skill might be
made available in a complete investigation of the ethnology
and natural history of the region. Mr. Turner left Washington
in June, 1882, and returned in the autumn of 1884. During
the last year he was engaged in the preparation of a report
which will appear in one of the forthcoming annual reports of
the Bureau.</p>




<h3>NECROLOGY.</h3>

<h4>MR. JAMES STEVENSON.</h4>


<p>The officers of the Bureau of Ethnology and all persons interested
in researches concerning the North American Indians
were this year called to lament the death of Mr. James
Stevenson, who had made regular and valuable contributions
to the publications and collections of the Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevenson was born in Maysville, Kentucky, on the 24th
of December, 1840. When but a boy of 16 he became associated
with Prof. F. V. Hayden, and accompanied him upon expeditions
into the regions of the upper Missouri and Yellowstone
rivers. Although the main objects of these expeditions were
geological, his tastes led him chiefly to the observation of the
customs and dialects of the Indians, and the facilities for such
study afforded him by the winters spent among the Blackfoot
and Dakota Indians excited and confirmed the anthropologic
zeal which absorbed the greater part of his life.</p>

<p>After military service during the civil war he resumed, in
1866, the studies which had been interrupted by it, and accompanied
Prof. Hayden to the Bad Lands of Dakota. From this
expedition and the action of the Congress of the United States
in 1866-’67, sprang the Hayden survey, and during its existence
Mr. Stevenson was its executive officer. In one of the
explorations from 1868 to 1878, which are too many to be
here enumerated, he climbed the Great Teton, and was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxv" id="pagexxv">[xxv]</a></span>
first white man known to have reached the ancient Indian altar
on its summit.</p>

<p>In 1879 the Hayden survey was discontinued, the Bureau
of Ethnology was organized, and the U. S. Geological Survey
was established. Mr. Stevenson, in addition to his duties as
the executive officer of the new survey, was detailed for research
in connection with the Bureau of Ethnology. In the subsequent
years he devoted the winters&mdash;from the incoming of the
field parties to their outgoing in the spring&mdash;chiefly to business
of the survey; his summers to his favorite researches. He explored
the cliff and cave dwellings of Arizona and New Mexico;
he unearthed in the Canyon de Chelly two perfect skeletons
of its prehistoric inhabitants; he investigated the religious
mythology of the Zuñi, and secured a complete collection of
fetich-gods, never before allowed out of their possession; he
studied the history and religions of the Navajo and the Tusayan,
and made an invaluable collection of pottery, costumes, and
ceremonial objects, which are now prominent in the U. S. National
Museum. But in the high mesas which were the field
of his explorations in 1885 he was attacked by the “mountain
fever” in its worst form. It was his first serious illness, and
his regular and temperate life saved him for the time. But a
visit to the same region in 1887 brought on a second attack of
this peculiar and distressing disease. He came home prostrated,
with symptoms of serious heart failure.</p>

<p>He died at the Gilsey House, in New York city, on the 25th
of July, 1888, and was buried in the cemetery of Rock Creek
church, near Washington.</p>




<h3>ACCOMPANYING PAPER.</h3>


<p>For the first time in the series of the Annual Reports of this
Bureau a single paper is submitted to exhibit the character of
the investigations undertaken and the facts collected by its
officers, with the results of their studies upon such collections.
But while the paper is single in form and in title, it includes,
in its illustrations and the text relating to them, nearly all
topics into which anthropology can properly be divided, and
therefore shows more diversity than would often be contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxvi" id="pagexxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
in a volume composed of separate papers by several authors.
Its subject-matter being essentially pictorial, it required a
large number of illustrations, twelve hundred and ninety-five
figures being furnished in the text, besides fifty-four full-page
plates, which, with their explanation and discussion, expanded
the volume to such size as to exclude other papers.</p>


<h4>PICTURE-WRITING OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS, BY GARRICK
MALLERY.</h4>

<p>The papers accompanying the Fourth Annual Report of this
Bureau, which was for the fiscal year 1882-’83, included one
under the title “Pictographs of the North American Indians, a
Preliminary Paper, by Garrick Mallery.” Although that work
was of considerable length and the result of much research
and study, it was in fact as well as in title preliminary. The
substance and general character of the information obtained
at that time on the subject was published not only for the
benefit of students already interested in it, but also to excite
interest in that branch of study among active explorers in the
field and, indeed, among all persons engaged in anthropologic
researches. For the convenience of such workers as were
invited in general terms to become collaborators, suggestions
were offered for the examination, description, and study of
the objects connected with this branch of investigation which
might be noticed or discovered by them. The result of this
preliminary publication has shown the wisdom of the plan
adopted. Since the distribution of the Fourth Annual Report
pictography in its various branches has become, far more than
ever before, a prominent feature in the publications of learned
societies, in the separate works of anthropologists, and in the
notes of scientific explorers. The present paper includes, with
proper credit to the authors quoted or cited, many contributions
to this branch of study which obviously have been
induced by the preliminary paper before mentioned.</p>

<p>The interest thus excited has continued to be manifested by
the publication of new information of importance, in diverse
shapes and in many languages, some of which has been received
too late for proper attention in this paper.</p>

<p>Col. Mallery’s studies in pictography commenced in the
field. He was stationed with his military command at Fort
Rice, on the upper Missouri river, in the autumn of 1876, and
obtained a copy of the remarkable pictograph which he then
called “A Calendar of the Dakota Nation,” and published under
that title, with interpretation and explanation, in Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span>, No. 1, of
the series of bulletins of the U. S. Geological and Geographical
Survey of the Territories, issued April 9, 1877. This work attracted
attention, and at the request of the Secretary of the
Interior he was ordered by the Secretary of War, on June 13,
1877, to report for duty, in connection with the ethnology of the
North American Indians, to the present Director of this Bureau,
then in charge of the Geographical and Geological Survey of
the Rocky Mountain Region. Upon the organization of the
Bureau of Ethnology, in 1879, Col. Mallery was appointed ethnologist,
and has continued in that duty without intermission,
supplementing field explorations by study of all accessible
anthropologic literature and by extensive correspondence. His
attention has been steadily directed to pictography and to sign-language,
which branches of study are so closely connected
that neither can be successfully pursued to the exclusion of
the other, but his researches have by no means been confined
to those related subjects.</p>

<p>The plan and scope of the present work may be very briefly
stated as follows:</p>

<p>After some introductory definitions and explanations general
remarks are submitted upon the grand division of petroglyphs
or pictures upon rocks as distinct from other exhibitions of
pictography. This division is less susceptible of interpretation
than others, but it claims special interest and attention because
the locality of production is fixed, and also because the antiquity
of workmanship may often be determined with more
certainty than can that of pictures on less enduring and readily
transportable objects. Descriptions, with illustrations, are
presented of petroglyphs in North America, including those
in several provinces of Canada, in many of the states and
territories of the United States, in Mexico, and in the West
Indies. A large number from Central and South America<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxviii" id="pagexxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
also appear, followed by examples from Australia, Oceanica,
Europe, Africa, and Asia, inserted chiefly for comparison
with the picture-writings in America, to which the work is
specially devoted, and therefore styled extra-limital petroglyphs.
The curious forms called cup sculptures are next
discussed, followed by a chapter on pictographs considered
generally, which condenses the results of much thought. The
substances, apart from rocks, on which picture-writing is found
are next considered, and afterwards the instruments and materials
by which they are made. The subjects of pictography
and the practices which elucidate it are classified under
several headings, viz: <i>Mnemonic</i>, subdivided into (1) Knotted
cords and objects tied, (2) Notched or marked sticks, (3) Wampum,
(4) Order of songs, (5) Traditions, (6) Treaties, (7)
Appointment, (8) Numeration, (9) Accounting; <i>Chronology</i>,
in which the charts at first called calendars, but now, in
correct translation of the Indian terms, styled winter-counts,
are discussed and illustrated with the care required by their
remarkable characteristics; <i>Notices</i>, which chapter embraces
(1) Notice of visit, departure, and direction, (2) Direction by
drawing topographic features, (3) Notice of condition, (4)
Warning and guidance; <i>Communications</i>, including (1) Declaration
of war, (2) Profession of peace and friendship, (3)
Challenge, (4) Social and religious missives, (5) Claim or demand;
<i>Totems, titles, and names</i>, divided into (1) Pictorial tribal
designations, (2) Gentile and clan designation, (3) Significance
of tattoo marks, which topic is discussed at length, with
ample illustration, and (4) Designations of individuals, subdivided
into insignia or tokens of authority, signs of individual
achievements, property marks, and personal names. Some of
the facts presented are to be correlated with the antique forms
of heraldry and others with proper names in modern civilization.</p>

<p>The topic <i>Religion</i>, considered in the popular significance
of that term, is divided into (1) Symbols of the supernatural,
(2) Myths and mythic animals, (3) Shamanism, (4) Charms
and amulets, (5) Religious ceremonies, and (6) Mortuary practices.
<i>Customs</i> are divided into (1) Cult associations, (2)
Daily life and habits, (3) Games. The chapter entitled <i>Historic</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxix" id="pagexxix">[xxix]</a></span>
presents (1) Record of expeditions, (2) Record of battle,
which includes a highly interesting Indian pictured account
of the battle of the Little Big Horn, commonly called the
“Custer massacre,” (3) Record of migration, (4) Record of
notable events. The <i>Biographic</i> chapter gives too many minutiæ
for particularization here, but is divided into (1) Continuous
record of events in life and (2) Particular exploits or
events. <i>Ideography</i> permeates and infuses all the matter under
the other headings, but is discussed distinctively and with evidential
illustrations in the sections of (1) abstract ideas expressed
objectively, and (2) symbols and emblems. In the latter
section the author suggests that the proper mode of interpretation
of pictographs whose origin and significance are unknown
is that they are to be primarily supposed to be objective
representations, but may be, and often are, ideographic, and in
a limited number of cases may have become symbolic, but that
the strong presumption without extrinsic evidence is against
the occult or esoteric symbolism often attributed to the markings
under discussion. The significance of colors is connected
with ideography and examples are given of the colors used in
many parts of the world for mere decoration, in ceremonies,
for death and mourning, for war and peace, and to designate
social status. The depiction of gesture and posture signs is
next discussed, showing the intimate relation between a
thought as expressed without words by signs, and a thought
expressed without words by pictures corresponding to those
signs.</p>

<p><i>Conventionalizing</i> is divided into conventional devices, which
were the precursors of writing, and the syllabaries and alphabets
evolved. The pictographic origin of all the current
alphabets of the world, often before discussed, receives further
explanation.</p>

<p>While comparison by the reader between all the illustrations
and the facts recorded and the suggestions submitted
about them is essential to the utility of the work, the author
gives, as representing his own mode of study, found to be advantageous
in use, a chapter on <i>Special Comparison</i>, divided
into (1) Typical style, (2) Homomorphs and symmorphs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxx" id="pagexxx">[xxx]</a></span>
(3) Composite forms, (4) Artistic skill and methods. This
chapter is followed by one with which it is closely connected,
styled <i>Means of Interpretation</i>, divided into (1) Marked characters
of known significance, (2) Distinctive costumes, weapons,
and ornaments, (3) Ambiguous characters with known
meanings, the latter being chiefly a collection of separate
figures which would not be readily recognized without labels,
but which are understood through reliable authority. Finally,
under the rather noncommittal title of <i>Controverted Pictographs</i>,
the subjects of fraud and error are discussed with striking examples
and useful cautions.</p>

<p>From this brief paraphrase of the table of contents, it is obvious
that nearly all branches of anthropology are touched upon.
It is also to be remarked that the work is unique because it
presents the several anthropologic topics recorded by the Indians
themselves according to their unbiased conceptions, and
in their own mode of writing. From this point of view the
anonymous and generally unknown pictographers may be
considered to be the primary authors of the treatise and Col.
Mallery a discoverer, compiler, and editor. But such depreciative
limitation of his functions would ignore the originality of
treatment pervading the work and the systematic classification
and skillful analysis shown in it which enhance its value and
interest.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>An essay entitled “Pictographs of the North American Indians: A
Preliminary Paper,” appeared in the Fourth Annual Report of the
Bureau of Ethnology. The present work is not a second edition of
that essay, but is a continuation and elaboration of the same subject.
Of the eighty-three plates in that paper not one is here reproduced,
although three are presented with amendments; thus fifty-one of the
fifty-four plates in this volume are new. Many of the text figures,
however, are used again, as being necessary to the symmetry of the
present work, but they are now arranged and correlated so as to be
much more useful than when unmethodically disposed as before, and
the number of text figures now given is twelve hundred and ninety-five
as against two hundred and nine, the total number in the former
paper. The text itself has been rewritten and much enlarged. The
publication of the “Preliminary Paper” has been of great value in the
preparation of the present work, as it stimulated investigation and
report on the subject to such an extent that it is now impossible
to publish within reasonable limits of space all the material on hand.
Indeed, after the present work had been entirely written and sent to
the Public Printer, new information came to hand which ought to be
published, but can not now be inserted.</p>

<p>It is also possible to give more attention than before to the picture-writing
of the aboriginal inhabitants of America beyond the limits of
the United States. While the requirements of the acts of Congress
establishing the Bureau of Ethnology have been observed by directing
main attention to the Indians of North America, there is sufficient
notice of Central and South America to justify the present title, in
which also the simpler term “picture-writing” is used instead of “pictographs.”</p>

<p>Picture-writing is a mode of expressing thoughts or noting facts by
marks which at first were confined to the portrayal of natural or artificial
objects. It is one distinctive form of thought-writing without<span class="pagenum"><a name="page026" id="page026">[26]</a></span>
reference to sound, gesture language being the other and probably earlier
form. Whether remaining purely ideographic, or having become
conventional, picture-writing is the direct and durable expression of
ideas of which gesture language gives the transient expression. Originally
it was not connected with the words of any language. When
adopted for syllabaries or alphabets, which is the historical course of
its evolution, it ceased to be the immediate and became the secondary
expression of the ideas framed in oral speech. The writing common
in civilization may properly be styled sound-writing, as it does not
directly record thoughts, but presents them indirectly, after they have
passed through the phase of sound. The trace of pictographs in alphabets
and syllabaries is discussed in the present work under its proper
heading so far as is necessary after the voluminous treatises on the topic,
and new illustrations are presented. It is sufficient for the present
to note that all the varied characters of script and print now current
are derived directly or mediately from pictorial representations
of objects. Bacon well said that “pictures are dumb histories,” and he
might have added that in the crude pictures of antiquity were contained
the germs of written words.</p>

<p>The importance of the study of picture-writing depends partly upon
the result of its examination as a phase in the evolution of human
culture. As the invention of alphabetic writing is admitted to be the
great step marking the change from barbarism to civilization, the history
of its earlier development must be valuable. It is inferred from
internal evidence, though not specifically reported in history, that picture-writing
preceded and generated the graphic systems of Egypt,
Assyria, and China, but in America, especially in North America, its
use is still current. It can be studied here without any requirement
of inference or hypothesis, in actual existence as applied to records
and communications. Furthermore, the commencement of its evolution
into signs of sound is apparent in the Aztec and the Maya
characters, in which transition stage it was arrested by foreign conquest.
The earliest lessons of the genesis and growth of culture in
this important branch of investigation may, therefore, be best learned
from the western hemisphere. In this connection it should be noticed
that picture-writing is found in sustained vigor on the same continent
where sign language has prevailed and has continued in active operation
to an extent historically unknown in other parts of the world.
These modes of expression, i. e., transient and permanent thought-writing,
are so correlated in their origin and development that neither
can be studied to the best advantage without including the other.
Unacquainted with these facts, but influenced by an assumption that
America must have been populated from the eastern hemisphere, some
enterprising persons have found or manufactured American inscriptions
composed of characters which may be tortured into identity with
some of the Eurasian alphabets or syllabaries, but which sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page027" id="page027">[27]</a></span>
suggest letters of indigenous invention. This topic is discussed in its
place.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the present work there is no need to decide
whether sign-language, which is closely connected with picture-writing,
preceded articulate speech. It is sufficient to admit the high antiquity
of thought-writing in both its forms, and yet it is proper to notice a
strong current of recent opinions as indicated by Prof. Sayce (<i>a</i>) in his
address to the anthropologic section of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I see no escape from the conclusions that the chief distinctions of race were established
long before man acquired language. If the statement made by M. de Mortillet
is true, that the absence of the mental tubercle, or bony excrescence in which the
tongue is inserted, in a skull of the Neanderthal type found at La Naulette, indicates
an absence of the faculty of speech, one race at least of palæolithic man would have
existed in Europe before it had as yet invented an articulate language. Indeed it is
difficult to believe that man has known how to speak for any very great length of time.
* * * We can still trace through the thin disguise of subsequent modifications
and growth the elements, both lexical and grammatical, out of which language must
have arisen. * * * The beginnings of articulate language are still too transparent

<p>When a system of ideographic gesture signs prevailed and at the
same time any form of artistic representation, however rude, existed, it
would be expected that the delineations of the former would appear in
the latter. It was but one more and an easy step to fasten upon bark,
skins, or rocks the evanescent air pictures that still in pigments or
carvings preserve their ideography or conventionalism in their original
outlines. A transition stage between gestures and pictographs, in
which the left hand is used as a supposed drafting surface, upon which
the index draws lines, is exhibited in the Dialogue between Alaskan
Indians in the First Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology (<i>a</i>).
This device is common among deaf-mutes, without equal archeologic
importance, as it may have been suggested by the art of writing, with
which, even when not instructed in it, they are generally acquainted.</p>

<p>The execution of the drawings, of which the several forms of picture-writing
are composed, often exhibits the first crude efforts of graphic
art, and their study in that relation is of value.</p>

<p>When pictures are employed for the same purpose as writing, the
conception intended to be presented is generally analyzed and only its
most essential points are indicated, with the result that the characters
when frequently repeated become conventional, and in their later form
cease to be recognizable as objective portraitures. This exhibition of
conventionalizing has its own historic import.</p>

<p>It is not probable that much valuable information will ever be obtained
from ancient rock carvings or paintings, but they are important
as indications of the grades of culture reached by their authors,
and of the subjects which interested those authors, as is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="page028" id="page028">[28]</a></span>
in the appropriate chapters following. Some portions of these pictures
can be interpreted. With regard to others, which are not yet
interpreted and perhaps never can be, it is nevertheless useful to
gather together for synoptic study and comparison a large number of
their forms from many parts of the world. The present collection shows
the interesting psychologic fact that primitive or at least very ancient
man made the same figures in widely separated regions, though it is
not established that the same figures had a common significance. Indications
of priscan habitat and migrations may sometimes be gained
from the general style or type of the drawings and sculptures, which
may be divided into groups, although the influence of the environing
materials must always be considered.</p>

<p>The more modern specimens of picture-writing displayed on skins,
bark, and pottery are far more readily interpreted than those on rocks,
and have already afforded information and verification as to points of
tribal history, religion, customs, and other ethnologic details.</p>

<p>A criticism has been made on the whole subject of picture-writing
by the eminent anthropologist, Dr. Andree, who, in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ethnographische
Parallelen und Vergleiche</span> (<i>a</i>), has described and figured a large number
of examples of petroglyphs, a name given by him to rock-drawings
and now generally adopted. His views are translated as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But if we take a connected view of the petroglyphs to which the rock pictures,
generally made with red paint, are equivalent, and make a comparison of both, it
becomes evident that they are usually made for mere pastime and are the first
artistic efforts of rude nations. Nevertheless, we find in them the beginnings of
writing, and in some instances their transition to pictography as developed among
North American Indians becomes evident.</p></div>

<p>It appears, therefore, that Dr. Andree carefully excludes the picture-writings
of the North American Indians from his general censure, his
conclusion being that those found in other parts of the world usually
occupy a lower stage. It is possible that significance may yet be ascertained
in many of the characters found in other regions, and perhaps
this may be aided by the study of those in America; but no doubt
should exist that the latter have purpose and meaning. The relegation
to a trivial origin of such pictographs as are described and illustrated
in the present work will be abandoned after a thorough knowledge of
the labor and thought which frequently were necessary for their production.
American pictographs are not to be regarded as mere curiosities.
In some localities they represent the only intellectual remains
of the ancient inhabitants. Wherever found, they bear significantly
upon the evolution of the human mind.</p>

<p>Distrust concerning the actual significance of the ancient American
petroglyphs may be dispelled by considering the practical use of similar
devices by historic and living Indians for purposes as important to
them as those of alphabetic writing, these serving to a surprising extent
the same ends. This paper presents a large number of conclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="page029" id="page029">[29]</a></span>
examples. The old devices are substantially the same as the modern,
though improved and established in the course of evolution. The ideography
and symbolism displayed in these devices present suggestive
studies in psychology more interesting than the mere information or
text contained in the pictures. It must also be observed that when
Indians now make pictographs it is with intention and care&mdash;seldom for
mere amusement. Even when the labor is undertaken merely to supply
the trade demand for painted robes or engraved pipes or bark records,
it is a serious manufacture, though sometimes only imitative and
not intrinsically significant. In all other known instances in which
pictures are made without such specific intent as is indicated under the
several headings of this work, they are purely ornamental; but in such
cases they are often elaborate and artistic, not idle scrawls.</p>

<p>This paper is limited in its terms to the presentation of the most important
known pictographs of the American Indians, but examples
from other parts of the world are added for comparison. The proper
classification and correlation of the matter collected has required more
labor and thought than is apparent. The scheme of the work has been
to give in an arrangement of chapters and sections some examples with
illustrations in connection with each heading in the classification. This
plan has involved a large amount of cross reference, because in many
cases a character or a group of characters could be considered with
reference to a number of different characteristics, and it was necessary
to choose under which one of the headings it should be presented,
involving reference to that from the other divisions of the work. Sometimes
the decision was determined by taste or judgment, and sometimes
required by mechanical considerations.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that the limitation of the size of the present
volume required that the space occupied by the text should be subordinated
to the large amount of illustration. It is obvious that a
work on picture-writing should be composed largely of pictures, and
to allow room for them many pages of the present writer’s views have
been omitted. Whatever may be the disadvantage of this omission
it leaves to students of the work the opportunity to form their own
judgments without bias. Indeed, this writer confesses that although
he has examined and studied in their crude shape, as they went to the
printer, all the illustrations and descriptions now presented, he expects
that after the volume shall be delivered to him in printed form with its
synoptic arrangement he will be better able than now to make appropriate
remarks on its subject-matter. Therefore he anticipates that
careful readers will judiciously correct errors in the details of the work
which may have escaped him and that they will extend and expand
what is yet limited and partial. It may be proper to note that when
the writer’s observation has resulted in agreement with published
authorities or contributors, the statements that could have been made
on his own personal knowledge have been cited, when possible, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page030" id="page030">[30]</a></span>
the printed or manuscript works of others. Quotation is still more
requisite when there is disagreement with the authorities.</p>

<p>Thanks for valuable assistance are due and rendered to correspondents
and to officers of the Bureau of Ethnology and of the United
States Geological Survey, whose names are generally mentioned in
connection with their several contributions. Acknowledgment is also
made now and throughout the work to Dr. W. J. Hoffman, who has
officially assisted in its preparation during several years, by researches
in the field, in which his familiarity with Indians and his artistic skill
have been of great value. Similar recognition is due to Mr. De
Lancey W. Gill, in charge of the art department of the Bureau of
Ethnology and the U. S. Geological Survey, and to Mr. Wells M.
Sawyer, his assistant, specially detailed on the duty, for their work on
the illustrations presented. While mentioning the illustrations, it
may be noted that the omission to furnish the scale on which some of
them are produced is not from neglect, but because it was impossible to
ascertain the dimensions of the originals in the few cases where no scale
or measurement is stated. This omission is most frequently noticeable
in the illustrations of petroglyphs which have not been procured
directly by the officers of the Bureau of Ethnology. The rule in that
Bureau is to copy petroglyphs on the scale of one-sixteenth actual
size. Most of the other classes of pictographs are presented without
substantial reduction, and in those cases the scale is of little importance.</p>

<p>It remains to give special notice to the reader regarding the mode
adopted to designate the authors and works cited. A decision was
formed that no footnotes should appear in the work. A difficulty in
observing that rule arose from the fact that in the repeated citation of
published works the text would be cumbered with many words and
numbers to specify titles, pages and editions. The experiment was
tried of printing in the text only the most abbreviated mention, generally
by the author’s name alone, of the several works cited, and
to present a list of them arranged in alphabetic order with cross
references and catch titles. This list appears at the end of the work
with further details and examples of its use. It is not a bibliography
of the subject of picture-writing, nor even a list of authorities read
and studied in the preparation of the work, but it is simply a special
list, prepared for the convenience of readers, of the works and authors
cited in the text, and gives the page and volume, when there is more
than one volume in the edition, from which the quotation is taken.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="subhead">PETROGLYPHS.</span></h2>


<p>In the plan of this work a distinction has been made between a
petroglyph, as Andree names the class, or rock-writing, as Ewbank
called it, and all other descriptions of picture-writing. The criterion
for the former is that the picture, whether carved or pecked, or otherwise
incised, and whether figured only by coloration or by coloration
and incision together, is upon a rock either in situ or sufficiently large
for inference that the picture was imposed upon it where it was found.
This criterion allows geographic classification. In presenting the geographic
distribution, prominence is necessarily (because of the laws
authorizing this work) given to the territory occupied by the United
States of America, but examples are added from various parts of the
globe, not only for comparison of the several designs, but to exhibit the
prevalence of the pictographic practice in an ancient form, though probably
not the earliest form. The rocks have preserved archaic figures,
while designs which probably were made still earlier on less enduring
substances are lost.</p>

<p>Throughout the world in places where rocks of a suitable character
appear, and notably in South America, markings on them have been
found similar to those in North America, though until lately they have
seldom been reported with distinct description or with illustration.
They are not understood by the inhabitants of their vicinity, who generally
hold them in superstitious regard, and many of them appear
to have been executed from religious motives. They are now most
commonly found remaining where the population has continued to be
sparse, or where civilization has not been of recent introduction, with
exceptions such as appear in high development on the Nile.</p>

<p>The superstitions concerning petroglyphs are in accord with all other
instances where peoples in all ages and climes, when observing some
phenomenon which they did not understand, accounted for it by supernatural
action. The following examples are selected as of interest in
the present connection.</p>

<p>It must be premised with reference to the whole character of the
mythology and folk-lore of the Indians that, even when professed converts
to Christianity, they seem to have taken little interest in the
stories of the Christian church, whether the biblical narratives or the
lives and adventures of the saints, which are so constantly dwelt upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page032" id="page032">[32]</a></span>
throughout the Christian world that they have become folk-lore. The
general character of the Christian legends does not seem to have suited
the taste of Indians and has not at all impaired their affection for or
their belief in the aboriginal traditions.</p>

<p>Among the gods or demigods of the Abnaki are those who particularly
preside over the making of petroglyphs. Their name in the plural,
for there are several personages, is Oonagamessok. They lived in
caves by the shore and were never seen, but manifested their existence
by inscriptions on the rocks. The fact that these inscribed rocks
are now very seldom found is accounted for by the statement that the
Oonagamessok have become angry at the want of attention paid to
them since the arrival of the white people and have caused the pictures
to disappear. There is no evidence to determine whether this tradition
should be explained by the fact that the ingenious shamans of the
last century would sometimes produce a miracle, carving the rocks
themselves and interpreting the marks in their own way, or by the fact
that the rock inscriptions were so old that their origin was not remembered
and an explanation was, as usual, made by ascription to a special
divinity, perhaps a chieftain famous in the old stage of mythology, or
perhaps one invented for the occasion by the class of priests who from
immemorial antiquity have explained whatever was inexplicable.</p>

<p>At a rock near the mouth of the Magiguadavic river, at the time immediately
before the Passamaquoddy Indians chose their first governor
after the manner of the whites, the old Indians say there suddenly
appeared a white man’s flag carved on the rocks. The old Indians
interpreted this as a prophecy that the people would soon be abandoned
to the white man’s methods, and this came to pass shortly after. Formerly
they had a “Mayouett” or chief. Many other rock carvings are
said to have foretold what has since come to pass. Strange noises have
also been heard near them.</p>

<p>The Omaha superstition is mentioned on pages <a href="#page091">91</a>-<a href="#page092">92</a> infra.</p>

<p>The Mandans had an oracle stone on which figures appeared on the
morning after a night of public fasting. They were deciphered by the
shaman, who doubtless had made them.</p>

<p>Mr. T. H. Lewis (<i>a</i>) gives the following tradition relating to the incised
bowlders in the upper Minnesota valley:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In olden times there used to be an object that marked the bowlders at night. It
could be seen, but its exact shape was indistinct. It would work making sounds
like hammering, and occasionally emit a light similar to that of a firefly. After
finishing its work it would give one hearty laugh like a woman laughing and then
disappear. The next morning the Indians would find another pictured bowlder in
the vicinity where the object had been seen the night previous.</p></div>

<p>Mr. J. W. Lynd (<i>a</i>) says of the Dakotas:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The deities upon which the most worship is bestowed, if, indeed, any particular
one is nameable, are Tunkan (Inyan) the Stone God and Wakinyan, the Thunder
Bird. The latter, as being the main god of war, receives constant worship and
sacrifices; whilst the adoration of the former is an every-day affair. The Tunkan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page033" id="page033">[33]</a></span>
the Dakotas say, is the god that dwells in stones or rocks, and is the oldest god. If
asked why it is considered the oldest, they will tell you because it is the hardest.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Charles Hallock, on the authority of Capt. Ed. Hunter, First
Cavalry, U. S. A., furnishes the following information respecting the
Assiniboin, Montana, rock pictures, which shows the reverence of these
Indians for the petroglyphs even when in ruins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some of the rocks of the sculptured cliff cleaved off and tumbled to the ground,
whereupon the Indians assembled in force, stuck up a pole, hung up some buffalo
heads and dried meat, had a song and dance, and carefully covered the detached
fragments (which were sculptured or painted) with cotton cloth and blankets. Jim
Brown, a scout, told Capt. Hunter that the Indians assembled at this station at
stated times to hold religious ceremonies. The pictures are drawn on the smooth
face of an outcrop or rocky projection.</p></div>

<p>Marcano (<i>a</i>) gives an account in which superstition is mixed with historic
tradition. It is translated as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The legend of the Tamanaques, transmitted by Father Gili, has also been invoked
in favor of an ancient civilization. According to the beliefs of this nation, there
took place in days of old a general inundation, which recalls the age of the great
waters of the Mexicans, during which the scattered waves beat against the Encaramada.
All the Tamanaques were drowned except one man and one woman, who fled
to the mountain of Tamacu or Tamanácu, situated on the banks of Asiveru (Cuchivero).
They threw above their heads the fruits of the palm tree, Mauritia, and saw
arising from their kernels the men and women who repeopled the earth. It was
during this inundation that Amalavica, the creator of mankind, arrived on a bark
and carved the inscription of Tepumereme. Amalavica remained long among the
Tamanaques, and dwelt in Amalavica-Jeutitpe (house). After putting everything
in order he set sail and returned “to the other shore,” whence he had come. “Did
you perchance meet him there?” said an Indian to Father Gili, after relating to him
this story. In this connection Humboldt recalls that in Mexico, too, the monk Sahagun
was asked whether he came from the other shore, whither Quetzalcoatl had
retired.</p>

<p>The same traveler adds: “When you ask the natives how the hieroglyphic characters
carved on the mountains of Urbana and Encaramada could have been traced,
they reply that this was done in the age of the great waters, at the time when their
fathers were able to reach the heights in their canoes.”</p>

<p>If these legends and these petroglyphs are proof of an extinct civilization, it is
astonishing that their authors should have left no other traces of their culture. To
come to the point, is it admissible that they were replaced by savage tribes without
leaving a trace of what they had been, and can we understand this retrograde
march of civilization when progress everywhere follows an ascending course?
These destructions of American tribes in place are very convenient to prop up theories,
but they are contrary to ethnologic laws.</p></div>

<p>The remarkable height of some petroglyphs has misled authors of
good repute as well as savages. Petroglyphs frequently appear on the
face of rocks at heights and under conditions which seemed to render
their production impossible without the appliances of advanced civilization,
a large outlay, and the exercise of unusual skill. An instance
among many of the same general character is in the petroglyphs at Lake
Chelan, Washington, where they are about 30 feet above the present
water level, on a perpendicular cliff, the base of which is in the lake.
On simple examination the execution of the pictographic work would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page034" id="page034">[34]</a></span>
seem to involve details of wharfing, staging, and ladders if operated
from the base, and no less elaborate machinery if approached from the
summit. Strahlenberg suggests that such elevated drawings were
made by the ingenious use of stone wedges driven into the rock, thus
affording support for ascent or descent, and reports that he actually
saw such stone wedges in position on the Yenesei river. A very
rough geological theory has been presented by others to account for
the phenomena by the rise of the rocks to a height far above the adjacent
surface at a time later than their carving.</p>

<p>But in the many cases observed in America it is not necessary to
propose either the hypothesis involving such elaborate work as is suggested
or one postulating enormous geological changes. The escarpment
of cliffs is from time to time broken down by the action of the
elements and the fragments fall to the base, frequently forming a talus
of considerable height, on which it is easy to mount and incise or paint on
the remaining perpendicular face of the cliff. When the latter adjoins
a lake or large stream, the disintegrated débris is almost immediately
carried off, leaving the drawings or paintings at an apparently inaccessible
altitude. When the cliff is on dry land, the rain, which is driven
against the face of the cliff and thereby increased in volume and force
at the point in question, also sweeps away the talus, though more
slowly. The talus is ephemeral in all cases, and the face of the cliff
may change in a week or a century, as it may happen, so its aspect
gives but a slight evidence of age. The presence, therefore, of the
pictures on the heights described proves neither extraordinary skill in
their maker nor the great antiquity which would be indicated by the
emergence of the pictured rocks through volcanic or other dynamic
agency. The age of the paintings and sculptures must be inferred from
other considerations.</p>

<p>Pictures are sometimes found on the parts of rocks which at present
are always, or nearly always, covered with water. On the sea shore at
Machias bay, Maine, the peckings have been continued below the line
of the lowest tides as known during the present generation. In such
cases subsidence of the rocky formation may be indicated. At Kejimkoojik
lake, Nova Scotia, incisions of the same character as those on
the bare surface of the slate rocks can now be seen only by the aid of
a water glass, and then only when the lake is at its lowest. This may
be caused by subsidence of the rocks or by rise of the water through
the substantial damming of the outlet. Some rocks on the shores of
rivers, e. g., those on the Kanahwa, in West Virginia, show the same
general result of the covering and concealment of petroglyphs by water,
except in an unusual drought, which may more reasonably be attributed
to the gradual elevation of the river through the rise of the surface
near its mouth than to the subsidence of the earth’s crust at the
locality of the pictured rocks.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that no hermeneutic key has been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page035" id="page035">[35]</a></span>
applicable to American pictographs, whether ancient on stone or modern
on bark, skins, linen, or paper. Nor has any such key been found
which unlocks the petroglyphs of any other people. Symbolism was
of individual origin and was soon variously obscured by conventionalizing;
therefore it requires separate study in every region. No interpreting
laws of general application to petroglyphs so far appear,
although types and tendencies can be classified. It was hoped that in
some lands petroglyphs might tell of the characters and histories of
extinct or emigrated peoples, but it now seems that knowledge of the
people who were the makers of the petroglyphs is necessary to any
clear understanding of their work. The fanciful hypotheses which
have been formed without corroboration, wholly from such works as
remain, are now generally discarded.</p>

<p>There is a material reason why the interpretation of petroglyphs is
attended with special difficulty. They have often become so blurred by
the elements and so much defaced where civilized man has penetrated
that they cease to have any distinct or at least incontrovertible features.
The remarks relating to Dighton rock, infra, Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page762">XXII</a></span>, are
in point.</p>

<p>Rock-carving or picture-writing on rocks is so old among the American
tribes as to have acquired a nomenclature. The following general
remarks of Schoolcraft (<i>a</i>) are of some value, though they apply with
any accuracy only to the Ojibwa and are tinctured with a fondness
for the mysterious:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For their pictographic devices the North American Indians have two terms, namely,
<i>Kekeewin</i>, or such things as are generally understood by the tribe, and <i>Kekeenowin</i>,
or teachings of the <i>medas</i> or priests and <i>jossakeeds</i> or prophets. The knowledge of
the latter is chiefly confined to persons who are versed in their system of magic
medicine, or their religion, and may be deemed hieratic. The former consists of
the common figurative signs, such as are employed at places of sepulture or by
hunting or traveling parties. It is also employed in the <i>muzzinabiks</i>, or rock-writings.
Many of the figures are common to both and are seen in the drawings generally;
but it is to be understood that this results from the figure alphabet being precisely
the same in both, while the devices of the nugamoons or medicine, wabino,
hunting, and war songs are known solely to the initiates who have learned them,
and who always pay high to the native professors for this knowledge.</p></div>

<p>In the Oglala Roster mentioned in Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span>, Section <a href="#page419">4</a>, infra,
one of the heads of families is called Inyanowapi, translated as Painted
(or inscribed) rock. A blue object in the shape of a bowlder is connected
with the man’s head by the usual line, and characters too minute for
useful reproduction appear on the bowlder. The name is interesting as
giving the current Dakota term for rock-inscriptions. The designation
may have been given to this Indian because he was an authority on the
subject and skilled either in the making or interpretation of petroglyphs.</p>

<p>The name “Wikhegan” was and still is used by the Abnaki to signify
portable communications made in daily life, as distinct from the
rock carvings mentioned above, which are regarded by them as mystic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page036" id="page036">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the curious facts in connection with petroglyphs is the meager
notice taken of them by explorers and even by residents other than
the Indians, who are generally reticent concerning them. The present
writer has sometimes been annoyed and sometimes amused by this
indifference. The resident nearest to the many inscribed rocks at Kejimkoojik
Lake, Nova Scotia, described in Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>, Section <a href="#page037">1</a>, was a
middle-aged farmer of respectable intelligence who had lived all his life
about 3 miles from those rocks, but had only a vague notion of their
character, and with difficulty found them. A learned and industrious
priest, who had been working for many years on the shores of Lake
Superior preparing not only a dictionary and grammar of the Ojibwa
language, but an account of Ojibwa religion and customs, denied the
present existence of any objects in the nature of petroglyphs in that
region. Yet he had lived for a year within a mile of a very important
and conspicuous pictured rock, and, on being convinced of his error by
sketches shown him, called in his Ojibwa assistant and for the first time
learned the common use of a large group of words which bore upon the
system of picture-writing, and which he thereupon inserted in his dictionary,
thus gaining from the visitor, who had come from afar to study
at the feet of this supposed Gamaliel, much more than the visitor gained
from him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="subhead">PETROGLYPHS IN NORTH AMERICA.</span></h2>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">CANADA.</span></h3>

<p>The information thus far obtained about petroglyphs in Canada is
meager. This may be partly due to the fact that through the region of
the Dominion now most thoroughly known the tribes have generally
resorted for their pictographic work to the bark of birch trees, which
material is plentiful and well adapted for the purpose. Indeed the
same fact affords an explanation of the paucity of rock-carvings or
paintings in the lands immediately south of the boundary line separating
the United States from the British possessions. It must also be
considered that the country on both sides of that boundary was in
general heavily timbered, and that even if petroglyphs are there they
may not even yet have been noticed. But that the mere plenty of birch
bark does not evince the actual absence of rock-pictures in regions
where there was also an abundance of suitable rocks, and where the
native inhabitants were known to be pictographers, is shown by the
account given below of the multitudes of such pictures lately discovered
in a single district of Nova Scotia. It is confidently believed that many
petroglyphs will yet be found in the Dominion. Others may be locally
known and possibly already described in publications which have
escaped the researches of the present writer. In fact, from correspondence
and oral narrations, there are indications of petroglyphs in
several parts of the Dominion besides those mentioned below, but their
descriptions are too vague for presentation here. For instance, Dr.
Boas says that he has seen a large number of petroglyphs in British
Columbia, of which neither he nor any other traveler has made distinct
report.</p>


<h4>NOVA SCOTIA.</h4>

<p>The only petroglyphs yet found in the peninsula of Nova Scotia are
in large numbers within a small district in Queens county, and they
comprise objects unique in execution and in interest. They were examined
by the present writer in the field seasons of 1887 and 1888, and
some were copied by him, but many more copies were taken in the last-mentioned
year by Mr. George Creed, of South Rawdon, Nova Scotia,
who had guided the writer to the locality. Attention was at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page038" id="page038">[38]</a></span>
confined to Fairy lake and its rocks. This lake is really a bay of a
larger lake which is almost exactly on the boundary line between Annapolis
and Queens counties, one of those forming the chain through
which the Liverpool river runs, and called Cegemacaga in More’s
History of Queens County (<i>a</i>), but according to Dr. Silas Rand in his
Reading Book in the Micmac Language (<i>a</i>), Kejimkoojik, translated
by him as “swelled parts,” doubtless referring to the expansion of the
Maitland river at its confluence with the Liverpool river.</p>

<p>The Fairy rocks, as distinct from others in the lake, are three in
number, and are situated on the east side of Kejimkoojik lake and
south of the entrance to Fairy lake. The northernmost of the three
rocks is immediately at the entrance, the westernmost and central rock
showing but a small surface at high water and at the highest stage of
the water being entirely submerged. Three other inscribed rocks are
about 2 miles south of these, at Piels (a corruption of Pierre’s) point,
opposite an island called Glodes or Gload island, so named from a well-known
Micmac family. These rocks are virtually a continuation of the
same formation with depressions between them. Two other localities in
the vicinity where the rocks are engraved, as hereafter described, are
at Fort Medway river and Georges lake. As they are all of the same
character, on the same material, and were obviously made by the same
people, they are all classed together, when referred to in this paper, as
at Kejimkoojik lake. All of these rocks are of schistose slate of the
Silurian formation, and they lie with so gentle a dip that their magnitudes
vary greatly with a slight change in the height of the water. On
August 27, 1887, when, according to the reports of the nearest residents,
the water was one foot above the average summer level, the unsubmerged
portion of the central rock then surrounded by water was an
irregular oval, the dimensions of which were 47 by 60 feet. The highest
points of the Fairy rocks at that date were no more than three and
few were more than two feet above the surface of the water. The inclination
near the surface is so small that a falling of the water of one
foot would double the extent of that part of the surface which, by its
smoothness and softness, is adapted to engraving. The inclination at
Piels point is steeper, but still allows a great variation of exposed
surface in the manner mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Creed first visited the Fairy rocks in July, 1881. His attention
was directed exclusively to the northernmost rock, which was then more
exposed than it was in September, 1887, and much of the inscribed
portion seen by him in 1881 was under water in 1887. The submerged
parts of the rocks adjoining those exposed are covered with incisions.
Many inscriptions were seen in 1881 by Mr. Creed through the water,
and others became visible through a water glass in 1887. His recollection
of the inscribed dates seen in 1881 is that some with French names
attached were of years near 1700, and that the worn appearance of the
figures and names corresponded with the lapse of time indicated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page039" id="page039">[39]</a></span>
those dates. A number of markings were noticed by him which are
not found in the parts now exposed, and were evidently more ancient
than most of the engravings on the latter. From other sources of information
it is evident that either from a permanent rise in the water
of the lake or from the sinking of the rocks, they formerly showed,
within the period of the recollection of people now living, a much
larger exposed surface than of late years, and that the parts long since
permanently submerged were covered with engravings. The inference
is that those engravings were made before Europeans had visited the
locality.</p>

<p>It is to be specially remarked that the exposed surfaces where the
rocks were especially smooth were completely marked over, no space
of 3 inches square being unmarked, and over nearly all of those choice
parts there were two, and in many cases three, sets of markings, above
one another, recognizable by their differing distinctness. It also
seemed that the second or third marking was upon plane surfaces where
the earlier markings had been nearly obliterated by time. With pains
and skill the earlier markings can be traced, and these are the outlines
which from intrinsic evidence are Indian, whereas the later and more
sharply marked outlines are obviously made by civilized men or boys,
the latest being mere initials or full names of persons, with dates attached.
Warning must be given that the ancient markings, which
doubtless were made by the Micmacs, will probably not only escape
the attention of the casual visitor, but even that an intelligent expert
observer who travels to the scene with some information on the subject,
and for the express purpose of finding the incisions, may fail to see
anything but names, ships, houses, and similar figures of obviously
modern design. This actually occurred within the week when the present
writer was taking copies of the drawings by a mode of printing
which left no room for fancy or deception. Indeed, frequently the
marks were not distinctly apparent until after they had been examined
in the printed copies.</p>

<p>The mode in which the copies were taken was by running over and
through their outlines a blue aniline pencil, and then pressing a wetted
sheet of ordinary printing paper upon them, so that the impression was
actually taken by the process of printing. During the two field seasons
mentioned, with the aid of Mr. Creed, three hundred and fifty
different engravings and groups of engravings were thus printed.
Some of these prints were of large dimensions, and included from ten
to fifty separate characters and designs.</p>

<p>On the parts exposed in 1887 there were dates from 1800 to the current
year, the number for the last year being much the greatest, which
was explained by the fact that the wonderfully beautiful lake had been
selected for a Sunday-school excursion. Over the greater part of the
surface visible in 1887 there were few levels specially favorable for marking,
and when these were found the double or treble use was in some
instances noticed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page040" id="page040">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>After the writer had inspected the rocks and discovered their characteristics,
and learned how to distinguish and copy their markings, it
seemed that, with the exception of a few designs recently dug or chipped
out by lumbermen or visitors, almost always initials, the only interesting
or ancient portions were scratchings which could be made on the
soft slate by any sharp instrument. The faces of the rocks were immense
soft and polished drawing-slates, presenting to any person who
had ever drawn or written before an irresistible temptation to draw or
write. The writer, happening to have with him an Indian stone arrow
which had been picked up in the neighborhood, used its point upon the
surface, and it would make as good scratches as any found upon the
rocks except the very latest, which were obviously cut by the whites
with metal knives.</p>

<p>As is above suggested, the peculiar multiplication of the characters
upon the most attractive of the slates affords evidence as to their
relative antiquity superior to that generally found in petroglyphs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page041" id="page041">[41]</a></span>
The existence of two or three different sets of markings, all visible
and of different degrees of obliteration or distinctness, is in itself
important; but, in addition to that, it is frequently the case that the
second and third in the order of time have associated with them dates,
from which the relative antiquity of the faintest, the dateless, can be
to some extent estimated. Dates of the third and most recent class
are attached to English names and are associated with the forms of English
letters; those of the second class accompany French names, and in
some cases have French designs. Figs. 1 and 2, about one-fourth original
size, are presented to give an idea of these peculiar palimpsests.</p>

</div>

<p>The presence of French names and styles of art in the drawings is
explained by a story which was communicated by Louis Labrador,
whose great-grandfather, old Ledore, according to his account, guided
a body of French Acadians who, at the time of the expulsion, were not
shipped off with the majority. They escaped the English in 1756 and
traveled from the valley of Annapolis to Shelbourne, at the extreme
southeast of the peninsula. During that passage they halted for a
considerable time to recruit in the beautiful valley along the Kejimkoojik
lake, on the very ground where these markings appear, which
also was on the ancient Indian trail. Another local tradition, told by
a resident of the neighborhood, gives a still earlier date for the French
work. He says that after the capture of Port Royal, now Annapolis,
in 1710, a party of the defeated Frenchmen, with a number of Indians
as guides, went with their cattle to the wide meadows upon Kejimkoojik
lake and remained there for a long time. It is exceedingly probable
that the French would have been attracted to scratch on this fascinating
smooth slate surface whether they had observed previous markings
or not, but it seems evident that they did scratch over such previous
markings. The latter, at least, antedated the beginning of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>A general remark may be made regarding the Kejimkoojik drawings,
that the aboriginal art displayed in them did not differ in any important
degree from that shown in other drawings of the Micmacs and the
Abnaki in the possession of the Bureau of Ethnology. Also that the
rocks there reveal pictographic tendencies and practices which suggest
explanations of similar work in other regions where less evidence
remains of intent and significance. The attractive material of the
slates and their convenient situation tempted past generations of Indians
to record upon them the images of their current thoughts and
daily actions. Hence the pictographic practice went into operation
at this locality with unusual vigor and continuity. Although at Kejimkoojik
lake there is an exceptional facility for determining the relative
dates of the several horizons of scratchings, the suggestion there
evoked may help to ascertain similar data elsewhere.</p>


<h4>ONTARIO.</h4>

<p>Mr. Charles Hallock kindly communicates information concerning
pictographs on Nipigon bay, which is a large lake in the province of Ontario,
30 miles northwest of Lake Superior, with which it is connected
by Nipigon river. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The pictographs, which are principally of men and animals, occupy a zone some 60
feet long and 5 feet broad, about midway of the face of the rock; they are painted
in blood-red characters, much darker than the color of the cliff itself.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page043" id="page043">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>He also, later, incloses a letter received by himself from Mr. Newton
Flanagan, of the Hudson Bay Company, an extract from which is as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About the dimensions of the red rock in Nipigon bay, upon which appear the Indian
painted pictures, as near as I can give you at present, the face of the rock
fronting the water is about 60 feet, rising to a greater height as it runs inland. The
width along the water is something like 900 yards, depth quite a distance inland.
The pictures are from 10 to 15 or perhaps 20 feet above the water; the pictures are
representations of human figures, Indians in canoes, and of wild animals. They are
supposed to have been painted ages ago, by what process or for what reason I am
unable to tell you, nor do I know how the paint is made indelible.</p>

<p>As far as I can gather, the Indians here have no traditions in regard to those
paintings, which I understand occur in several places throughout the country, and
none of the Indians hereabouts nowadays practice any such painting.</p></div>


<h4>MANITOBA.</h4>

<p>Mr. Hallock also furnishes information regarding a petroglyph, the
locality of which he gives as follows: Roche Percée, on the Souris
river, in Manitoba, near the international boundary, 270 miles west of
Dufferin, and nearly due north from Bismarck. This is an isolated
rock in the middle of a plain, covered with pictographs of memorable
events. It stands back from the river a half mile.</p>

<p>Mr. A. C. Lawson (<i>a</i>) gives an illustrated account of petroglyphs on the
large peninsula extending into the Lake of the Woods and on an island
adjacent to it. Strictly speaking this peninsula is in the district of
Keewatin, but it is very near the boundary line of Manitoba, to which
it is attached for administrative purposes. The account is condensed
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the north side of this peninsula, i. e., on the south shore of the northern half
of the lake, about midway between the east and west shores, occurs one of the two
sets of hieroglyphic markings. Lying off shore at a distance of a quarter to a half
a mile, and making with it a long sheltered channel, is a chain of islands, trending
east and west. On the south side of one of these islands, less than a mile to the west
of the first locality, is to be seen the other set of inscriptions. The first set occurs
on the top of a low, glaciated, projecting point of rock, which presents the characters
of an ordinary roche moutonnée. The rock is a very soft, foliated, green,
chloritic schist, into which the characters are more or less deeply carved. The top
of the rounded point is only a few feet above the high-water mark of the lake, whose
waters rise and fall in different seasons through a range of ten feet. The antiquity
of the inscriptions is at once forced upon the observer upon a careful comparison of
their weathering with that of the glacial grooves and striæ, which are very distinctly
seen upon the same rock surface. Both the ice grooves and carved inscriptions
are, so far as the eye can judge, identical in extent of weathering, though
there was doubtless a considerable lapse of time between the disappearance of the
glaciers and the date of the carving.</p>

<p>The island on which were found the other inscriptions is one of the many steep
rocky islands known among the Indians as Ka-ka-ki-wa-bic min-nis, or Crow-rock
island. The rock is a hard greenstone, not easily cut, and the inscriptions are not
cut into the rock, but are painted with ochre, which is much faded in places. The
surface upon which the characters are inscribed forms an overhanging wall protected
from the rain, part of which has fallen down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page044" id="page044">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians of the present day have no traditions about these inscriptions
beyond the supposition that they must have been made by the “old people” long ago.</p></div>

<p>The sketches published as copies of these glyphs show spirals,
concentric circles, crosses, horseshoe forms, arrow shapes, and other
characters similar to those found on rocks in the southwestern part of
the United States, and also to petroglyphs in Brazil, examples from
both of which regions are presented in this work, under their appropriate
headings.</p>


<h4>BRITISH COLUMBIA.</h4>

<p>Dr. Franz Boas (<i>a</i>) published an account of a petroglyph on Vancouver
island (now presented as Fig. 3) which, slightly condensed, is
translated as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp076_pg044h.png">
<img src="images/dp076_pg044.png" class="hires" width="500" height="147" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph on Vancouver island.</div>
</div>

<p>The accompanying rock picture is found on the eastern shore of
Sproat lake, near its southern outlet. Sproat lake lies about 10 kilometers
north of the upper end of the Alberni fiord, which cuts deep
into the interior of Vancouver island. In former times this region was
the territory of the Hōpetschisāth, a tribe of the Nootka or Aht, who
even now have a village some miles below the lake, at the entrance of
Stamp river into the main river. That tribe, according to the statement
of some of its older members, was a branch of the Kowitchin, who
occupy the east side of Vancouver island, some kilometers northeast
of the upper end of Alberni fiord. At that time the Ts’ēschāáth,
another tribe of the Nootka, are said to have ascended the fiord and
mixed with the Hōpetschisāth. The present inhabitants of the region
know nothing concerning the origin of the rock picture. According to
their legend, the rock on which it is carved was once the house of
Kwótiath. Kwótiath is the wandering divinity in Nootka mythology,
and corresponds approximately to the raven of the Tlinkit and Haida,
the Qäls of the Kowitchin. The picture is found on a perpendicular
rock wall about 7 meters high, which drops directly into the lake, so
that it was necessary to make the copy while standing in the water.
The rock is traversed in the middle by a broad cleft, narrowing below,
from which blocks have fallen out which bore part of the drawing. To
the north and south of the rock wall the shore rises gently, but rocky
portions are found everywhere. The lines of the drawing are flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="page045" id="page045">[45]</a></span>
grooves, about two or three fingers’ breadth, and in many places are
so weathered as to be hardly recognizable. They have been scraped
into the rock probably by the points of sticks rubbing moist sand
against it. No marks of blows of any kind are found. The figures are
here given in the same relative position in which they are found on the
rock, except that the upper one on the right hand is at a distance from
all the others, at the southern end of the rock. The objects represented
are evidently fishes or marine monsters. The middle figure to the left
of the cleft may be a manned boat, the fore part of which is probably
destroyed.</p>

<p>Dr. Boas says that the copy as found in the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Verhandlungen</span> is incorrect.
The design on the right hand is reversed and is now corrected.</p>

<p>Mr. G. M. Sproat (<i>a</i>) mentions this petroglyph:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is rudely done and apparently not of an old date. There are half a dozen figures
intended to represent fishes or birds&mdash;no one can say which. The natives affirm that
Quawteaht made them. In their general character these figures correspond to the
rude paintings sometimes seen on wooden boards among the Ahts, or on the seal-skin
buoys that are attached to the whale and halibut harpoons and lances. The
meaning of these figures is not understood by the people; and I dare say if the
truth were known, they are nothing but feeble attempts on the part of individual
artists to imitate some visible objects which they had strongly in their minds.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">UNITED STATES.</span></h3>

<p>Drawings or paintings on rocks are distributed generally over the
greater part of the territory of the United States.</p>

<p>They are found on bowlders formed by the sea waves or polished by
ice of glacial epochs; on the faces of rock ledges adjoining lakes and
streams; on the high walls of canyons and cliffs; on the sides and roofs
of caves; in short, wherever smooth surfaces of rock appear. Yet,
while they are so frequent, there are localities to be distinguished in
which they are especially abundant and noticeable. They differ markedly
in character of execution and apparent subject-matter.</p>

<p>An obvious division can be made between the glyphs bearing characters
carved or pecked and those painted without incision. There is
also a third, though small, class in which the characters are both incised
and painted. This division seems to coincide to a certain extent
with geographic areas and is not fully explained by the influence of
materials; it may, therefore, have some relation to the idiosyncrasy or
development of the several authors, and consequently to tribal habitat
and migrations.</p>

<p>In examining a chart of the United States in use by the Bureau of
Ethnology, upon which the distribution of the several varieties of
petroglyphs is marked, two facts are noticeable: First, the pecked and
incised characters are more numerous in the northern and those expressed
in colors more numerous in the southern areas. Second, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="page046" id="page046">[46]</a></span>
are two general groupings, distinguished by typical styles, one in the
north Atlantic states and the other in the south Pacific states.</p>

<p>The north Atlantic group is in the priscan habitat of the tribes of the
Algonquian linguistic family, and extends from Nova Scotia southward
to Pennsylvania, where the sculpturings are frequent, especially on the
Susquehanna, Monongahela, and Alleghany rivers, and across Ohio from
Lake Erie to the Kanawha river, in West Virginia. Isolated localities
bearing the same type are found westward on the Mississippi river
and a few of its western tributaries, to and including the Wind river
mountains, in Wyoming, the former habitat of the Blackfeet Indians.
All of these petroglyphs present typical characters, sometimes undefined
and complicated. From their presumed authors, they have been
termed the Algonquian type. Upon close study and comparison they
show many features in common which are absent in extra-limital areas.</p>

<p>Immediately south of the Kanawha river, in West Virginia, and extending
southward into Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina, the
pecked or sculptured petroglyphs are replaced by painted figures of a
style differing from the Algonquian. These are in the area usually designated
as Cherokee territory, but there is no evidence that they are
the work of that tribe; indeed, there is no indication of their authorship.
The absence of pecked characters in this area is certainly not
due to an absence of convenient material upon which to record them
as the country is as well adapted to the mode of incision as is the
northern Atlantic area.</p>

<p>Upon the Pacific slope a few pecked as well as colored petroglyphs
occur scattered irregularly throughout the extreme northern area west
of the Sierra Nevada, but on the eastern side of that range of mountains
petroglyphs appear in Idaho, which have analogues extending
south to New Mexico and Arizona, with remarkable groups at intervals
between these extremes. All of these show sufficient similarity of form
to be considered as belonging to a type which is here designated
“Shoshonean.” Tribes of that linguistic family still occupy, and for a
long time have occupied, that territory. Most of this Shoshonean group
consists of pecked or incised characters, though in the southern area
unsculptured paintings predominate.</p>

<p>On the western side of the Sierra Nevada, from Visalia southward,
at Tulare agency, and thence westward and southward along the Santa
Barbara coast, are other groups of colored petroglyphs showing typical
features resembling the Shoshonean. This resemblance may be merely
accidental, but it is well known that there was intercourse between the
tribes on the two sides of the Sierra Nevada, and the Shoshonean family
is also represented on the Pacific slope south of the mountain range
extending from San Bernardino west to Point Conception. In this manner
the artistic delineation of the Santa Barbara tribes may have been
influenced by contact with others.</p>

<p>Petroglyphs have seldom been found in the central area of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="page047" id="page047">[47]</a></span>
States. In the wooded region of the Great lakes characters have been
depicted upon birch bark for at least a century, while in the area between
the Mississippi river and the Rocky mountains the skins of buffalo
and deer have been used. Large rocks and cliffs favorably situated
are not common in that country, which to a great extent is prairie.</p>

<p>In the general area of these typical groups characters are frequently
found which appear intrusive, i. e., they have a strong resemblance
not only to those found in other American groups, but are nearly identical
with characters in other parts of the world. This fact, clearly
established, prevents the adoption of any theory as to the authorship
of many of the petroglyphs and thwarts attempts to ascertain their
signification.</p>


<h4>ALASKA.</h4>

<p>Ensign Albert P. Niblack, U. S. Navy, (<i>a</i>) gives a brief account, with
sketches, reproduced here as Fig. 4, of petroglyphs in Alaska, which
were taken from rocks from the ancient village of Stikine, near Fort
Wrangell. Others were found on rocks just above high-water mark
around the sites of ruined and abandoned villages.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in Alaska.</div>
</div>

<p>In the upper character the Alaskan typical style of human faces is
noticeable. The lower gives a representation of the orca or whale
killer, which the Haida believe to be a demon called Skana, about
which there are many mythic tales. Mr. Niblack remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In their paintings the favorite colors used are black, light green, and dark red.
Whether produced in painting, tattooing, or relief carving, the designs are somewhat
conventional. However rude the outline, there are for some animals certain
conventional signs that clearly indicate to the initiated what figure is meant. With
the brown bear it is the protruding tongue; with the beaver and wolf it is the character
of the teeth; with the orca, the fin; with the raven, the sharp beak; with the
eagle, the curved beak, etc.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page048" id="page048">[48]</a></span></p>


<h4>ARIZONA.</h4>

<p>Mr. G. K. Gilbert, of the U. S. Geological Survey, gives the following
information concerning petroglyphs observed by him in the vicinity
of San Francisco mountain, Arizona:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The localities of the sketches Figs. 5, 6, and 7 are about 35 miles east and southeast
of San Francisco mountain, the material being a red sandstone, which stands
in low buttes upon the plain. About these are mealing stones, fragments of pottery
and chipped flints, giving evidence of the residence of sedentary Indians. So many
localities of petroglyphs were seen that I regard it as probable that a large number
could be found by search. The drawings in every case but one were produced by
blows upon the surface of the rocks, breaking through the film of rock discolored by
weathering so as to reveal (originally) the color of the interior of the rock. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page049" id="page049">[49]</a></span>
single exception is the first pattern in Fig. 6, similar to the patterns on pottery and
blankets, produced by painting with a white pigment on red rock. The original
arrangement of the drawings upon the rock was not as a rule preserved, but they
have approximately the original arrangement. I neglected to record the scale of
the drawings, but the several pictures are drawn on approximately the same scale.</p></div>

<p>All of these figures partake of the general type designated as the
Shoshonean, and it is notable that close repetitions of some of the characters
appear in petroglyphs in Tulare valley and Owens valley, California,
which are described and illustrated in this section.</p>

<p>The object resembling a centipede, in Fig. 6, is a common form in
various localities in Santa Barbara county, California, as will be observed
by comparing the illustrations given in connection with that locality.
In other of the Arizona and New Mexican petroglyphs similar
outlines are sometimes engraved to signify the maize stalk.</p>

<p>Mr. Paul Holman, of the U. S. Geological Survey, reports that eight
miles below Powers butte, on a mesa bordering on the Gila river and
rising abruptly to the height of 150 feet, are pictographs covering the
entire vertical face. Also on the summit of a spur of Oatman mountain,
200 yards from the Gila and 300 feet above it, are numbers of pictographs.
Many of them are almost obliterated where they are on exposed
surfaces.</p>

<p>Lieut. Col. Emory (<i>a</i>) reports that on a table-land near the Gila
bend is a mound of granite bowlders, blackened by augite and covered
with unknown characters, the work of human hands. On the ground
near by were also traces of some of the figures, showing that some
of the pictographs, at least, were the work of modern Indians. Others
were of undoubted antiquity. He also reports in the same volume (<i>b</i>)
that characters upon rocks of questionable antiquity occur on the Gila
river at 32° 38′ 13″ N. lat. and 190° 7′ 30″ long. According to the
plate, the figures are found upon bowlders and on the face of the cliff
to the height of 30 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page050" id="page050">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieut. Whipple (<i>a</i>) remarks upon petroglyphs at Yampais spring,
Williams river, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The spot is a secluded glen among the mountains. A high shelving rock forms a
cave, within which is a pool of water and a crystal stream flowing from it. The
lower surface of the rock is covered with pictographs. None of the devices seem
to be of recent date.</p></div>

<p>Many of the country rocks lying on the Colorado plateau of northern
Arizona, east of Peach springs, bear petroglyphs of considerable artistic
workmanship. Some figures, observed by Dr. W. J. Hoffman in 1872,
were rather elaborate and represented the sun, human beings in various
styles approaching the grotesque, and other characters not understood.
All of those observed were made by pecking the surface of basalt
with a harder variety of stone.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilbert also obtained sketches of etchings in November, 1878, on
Partridge creek, northern Arizona, at the point where the Beale wagon
road comes to it from the east. He says: “The rock is cross-laminated
Aubrey sandstone and the surfaces used are faces of the laminæ. All
the work is done by blows with a sharp point. (Obsidian is abundant
in the vicinity.) Some inscriptions are so fresh as to indicate that the
locality is still resorted to. No Indians live in the immediate vicinity,
but the region is a hunting ground of the Wallapais and Avasupais
(Cosninos).”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the occasional visits of the above named tribes,
the characters submitted more nearly resemble those of other localities
known to have been made by the Moki Pueblos.</p>

<p>Rock drawings are of frequent occurrence along the entire extent of
the valley of the Rio Verde, from a short distance below Camp Verde
to the Gila river.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas V. Keam reports drawings on the rocks in Canyon Segy,
and in Keam’s canyon, northeastern Arizona. Some forms occurring at
the latter locality are found also upon Moki pottery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page051" id="page051">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Petroglyphs are reported by Lieut. Theodore Mosher, Twenty-second
Infantry, U. S. Army, to have been discovered by Lieut. Casey’s party
in December, 1887, on the Chiulee (or Chilalí) creek, 30 or 40 miles
from its confluence with San Juan river, Arizona. A photograph
made by the officer in charge of the party shows the characters to have
been outlined by pecking, the designs resembling the Shoshonean type
of pictographs, and those in Owens valley, California, a description of
which is given below.</p>

<p>A figure, consisting of two concentric circles with a straight line
running out from the larger circle, occurs, among other carvings, on
one of the many sculptured bowlders seen by Mr. J. R. Bartlett (<i>a</i>) in
the valley of the Gila river in Arizona. His representation of this
bowlder is here copied as Fig. 8. His language is as follows:</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph in Arizona.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I found hundreds of these bowlders covered with rude figures of men, animals, and
other objects of grotesque forms, all pecked in with a sharp instrument. Many of
them, however, were so much defaced by long exposure to the weather and by subsequent
markings, that it was impossible to make them out. Among these rocks I found
several which contained sculptures on the lower side, in such a position that it would
be impossible to cut them where they then lay. Some weighed many tons each
and would have required immense labor to place them there, and that, too, without
an apparent object. The natural inference was that they had fallen down from the
summit of the mountain after the sculptures were made on them. A few only
seemed recent; the others bore the marks of great antiquity.</p></div>

<p>In the collections of the Bureau of Ethnology is an album or sketch
book, which contains many drawings made by Mr. F. S. Dellenbaugh,
from which the following sketches of petroglyphs in Arizona are selected,
together with the brief references attached to each sheet.</p>

<p>Fig. 9 is a copy of characters appearing in Shinumo canyon, Arizona.
They are painted, the middle and right hand figures being red, the
human form having a white mark upon the abdomen; the left-hand
figure of a man is painted yellow, the two plumes being red.</p>

<h4>CALIFORNIA.</h4>

<p>In the foothills of California, wherever overhanging and rain-protected
rocks occur, they are covered with paintings of various kinds made by
Indians. Those on Rocky hill, some 15 miles east of Visalia, are especially
interesting. The sheltered rocks are here covered with images of
men, animals, and various inanimate objects, as well as curious figures.
The paint used is red, black, and white, and wherever protected it has
stood the ravages of time remarkably well. In many places the paintings
are as vivid as the day they were laid on. Deer, antelope, coyotes,
birds, and turtles are figured quite frequently, and may indicate either
names of chiefs or tribes, or animals slain in the hunt. Here are also
circles, spirals, crowns or bars, etc., signs the meaning of which is yet
doubtful.</p>

<p>Mr. H. W. Turner, in a letter dated June 3, 1891, furnishes sketches
(Fig. 11) from this locality, and a description of them as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 309px;">
<a href="images/dp085_pg053h.png">
<img src="images/dp085_pg053.png" class="hires" width="309" height="500" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs near Visalia, California.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I send herewith a rough sheet of drawings of figures on the sheltered face of a
huge granite cropping in Tulare county, California. One-half of the cropping had
split off, leaving a nearly plane surface, on which the figures were drawn in red,
white, and black pigments. The locality is known as Rocky point. They are now
quarrying granite at the place. It lies about 12 miles nearly due east of Visalia, in
the first foothills and south of Yokall creek. The figures appear to have been drawn
many years ago, and numbers of them are now indistinct.</p></div>

<p>During the summer of 1882 Dr. Hoffman visited the Tule river agency,
California, where he found a large rock painting, of which Fig. <a href="#page638">983</a>,
infra, is a copy made by him. His description of it is as follows:</p>

<p>“The agency is upon the western side of the Sierra Nevada, in the
headwater canyons of the branches of the south fork of Tule river. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page053" id="page053">[53]</a></span>
country is at present occupied by several tribes of the Mariposan
linguistic stock, and the only answer made to inquiries respecting the
age or origin of the painting was that it was found there when the ancestors
of the present tribes arrived. The local migrations of the various
Indian tribes of this part of California are not yet known with sufficient
certainty to determine to whom the records may be credited, but
all appearances with respect to the weathering and disintegration of the
rock upon which the record is engraved, the appearance of the coloring
matter subsequently applied, and the condition of the small depressions
made at the time for mixing the pigments with a viscous substance, indicate
that the work was performed about a century ago.</p>

<p>“The Indians now at Tule river have occupied that part of the state
for at least one hundred years, and the oldest now living state that the
records were found by their ancestors, though whether more than two
generations ago could not be ascertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page054" id="page054">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“The drawings were outlined by pecking with a piece of quartz or other
siliceous rock, the depth varying from a mere visible depression to a
third of an inch. Having thus satisfactorily depicted the several ideas,
colors were applied which appear to have penetrated the slight interstices
between the crystalline particles of the rock, which had been
bruised and slightly fractured by hammering with a piece of stone. It
appears probable, too, that to insure better results the hammering was
repeated after application of the colors.</p>

<p>“Upon a small bowlder, under the natural archway formed by the
breaking of the large rock, small depressions were found which had
been used as mortars for grinding and mixing the colors. These depressions
average 2 inches in diameter and about 1 inch in depth.
Traces of color still remain, mixed with a thin layer of a shining substance
resembling a coating of varnish and of flinty hardness. This
coating is so thin that it can not be removed with a steel instrument,
and appears to have become a part of the rock itself.</p>

<p>“From the animals depicted upon the ceiling it seems that both beaver
and deer were found in the country, and as the beaver tail and the hoofs
of deer and antelope are boiled to procure glue, it is probable that the
tribe which made these pictographs was as far advanced in respect to
the making of glue and preparing of paints as most other tribes throughout
the United States.</p>

<p>“Examination shows that the dull red color is red ocher, found in various<span class="pagenum"><a name="page055" id="page055">[55]</a></span>
places in the valley, while the yellow was an ocherous clay, also
found there. The white color was probably obtained there, and is evidently
earthy, though of what nature can only be surmised, not sufficient
being obtainable from the rock picture to make satisfactory analysis
with the blow-pipe. The composition of the black is not known,
unless it was made by mixing clay and powdered charcoal. The latter
is a preparation common at this day among other tribes.</p>

<p>“An immense granite bowlder, about 20 feet in thickness and 30 in
length, is so broken that a lower quarter is removed, leaving a large
square passageway through its entire diameter almost northwest and
southeast. Upon the western wall of this passageway is a collection of
the colored sketches of which Fig. <a href="#page638">983</a> is a reduced copy. The entire
face of the rock upon which the pictograph occurs measures about 12
or 15 feet in width and 8 in height. The largest human figure measures
6 feet in height, from the end of the toes to the top of the head, the
others being in proportion as represented.</p>

</div>

<p>“Upon the ceiling are a number of well executed drawings of the
beaver, bear, centipede (Fig. 12), and bald eagle (Fig. 13). Many of
the other forms indicated appear to represent some variety of insects,
several of which are drawn with exaggerated antennæ, as in Fig. 14.
It is curious to note the gradual blending of forms, as, for instance,
that of the bear with those resembling the human figure, often found
among the Shoshonean types in Arizona and New Mexico, some of
which are described and figured infra.</p>

The drawing is executed neatly and measures about 18 inches in length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page056" id="page056">[56]</a></span>

other form in Fig. 16 is white and is on the southern vertical wall of the

<h5>OWENS VALLEY.</h5>

<p>In the range of mountains forming the northwestern boundary of
Owens valley are extensive groups of petroglyphs, apparently dissimilar
to those found west of the Sierra Nevada. Dr. Hoffman, of
the Bureau of Ethnology, hastily examined them in 1871 and more
thoroughly in the autumn of 1884. They are now represented in Pls. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>
to <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span>. So large a space is given to these illustrations because of their
intrinsic interest, and also because it is desirable to show for one
locality what is true of some others, viz, the very large number of petroglyphs
still to be found in groups and series. Even with the present
illustrations, the petroglyphs in Owens valley are by no means exhaustively
shown.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoffman’s report is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page057" id="page057">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of the most important series of groups is that in the northern portion of
Owens valley, between the White mountains on the east and the Benton range on
the west. On the western slope of the latter, at Watterson’s ranch, is a detached
low butte or mesa, upon the blackened basaltic bowlders and cliffs of which are
numerous deeply cut characters, the most interesting of which are reproduced in
Pls. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>. The illustrations are, approximately, one-twelfth real size. The designs
of footprints, in the lower left-hand corner of Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, vary in depth from half an
inch to 1&frac12; inches. They appear to have been pecked and finally worked down to
a uniform and smooth surface by rubbing, as if with a piece of stone or with wood
and sand.</p>

<p>In almost all, if not all, instances throughout the entire series referred to in this
description the sculptured surfaces have assumed the same shining blackened luster
as the original and undisturbed surface of the bowlder, caused by gradual oxidation
of the iron present. This would seem to indicate considerable antiquity of the
petroglyphs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page058" id="page058">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>On the northeast angle of the mesa referred to were found the remains of an old
camp, over which were scattered large quantities of arrowheads, knives, and flakes
of obsidian. This in itself would be insignificant, but the fact that many of the
specimens of this material have been lying exposed to the elements until the upper
surface has undergone change in color, so as to become bleached and friable, in some
instances to the depth of from one-tenth to one-fourth of an inch, warrants the inference
that the relics may have been made by the same people who made the petroglyphs,
as the worked relics generally differ from those of the present Indians by
being larger and less elaborately finished.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the southeastern slope of the mesa are a number of flat rocks
bearing mortar holes, which have no doubt been used in grinding grass seed and
other grains.</p>

<p>In general type these petroglyphs correspond very closely to those of other areas,
in which the so-called Shoshonian types occur, the most common, apart from those
presented in Pls. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>, consisting of concentric circles, rings, footprints of the
bear and of man, and various outlines of the human form, beside numerous unintelligible
forms.</p>

</div>

<p>Southeastward of this locality there is a low divide leading across the Benton
range into the broad, arid, sloping sand desert of Owens valley proper, but it is not
until a point 12 miles south of Benton, along the line of the old stage road, is reached
that petroglyphs of any consequence are met with. From this point southward, for
a distance of 6 miles, large exposures and bowlders of basalt are scattered, upon
which are great numbers of petroglyphs, pecked into the rock to depths of from half
an inch to 1&frac12; inches, and representing circles, footprints, human forms, etc.</p>

<p>The first series of illustrations, selected from numerous closely-connected bowlders,
are here presented on Pls. <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span>. The designs marked <i>a</i> on Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span> resemble serpents,
while that at <i>d</i> is obviously such. This device is on the horizontal surface,
and is pecked to the depth of about 1 inch. The scale of the drawing is one-thirtieth
of the original petroglyph. The characters indicating the human form in <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>,
and <i>h</i> resemble the ordinary Shoshonian type, and are like those from various localities
in Arizona and southern Utah and Colorado.</p>

<p>The upper characters in <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> on Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV</span> represent the trail of a grizzly bear&mdash;as indicated
by the immense claws&mdash;followed by a human footprint. The original sculpturings
are clearly cut, the toes of the man’s foot being cup-like, as if drilled with a
blunt piece of wood and sand. The tracks average 15 inches in length and vary in
depth from half an inch to more than an inch. The course of direction of the tracks,
which are cut upon a horizontal surface, is from north-northeast to south-southwest.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> is the semblance of an apparently two-headed snake, as also in <i>a</i> on Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span>. It
is possible that this was pecked into the rock to record the finding of such an anomaly.

<p>For the space of 4 miles southward there are a few scattered petroglyphs, to which
reference will be made below, and the greatest number of characters are not found
until the southernmost extremity of the entire series is reached. These are over the
surface of immense bowlders lying on the east side of the road where it passes
through a little valley known locally as the Chalk grade, probably on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page059" id="page059">[59]</a></span>
the whitened appearance of the sand and of some of the embankments. A general
view of the faces of the bowlders upon which the chief sculpturings occur is presented
in Fig. 17. The petroglyphs are represented in Pls. <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span>.</p>

<p>The figures presented in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span> are, with one exception, each about one-thirtieth
the size of the original. The animal character in <i>e</i> is upon the top of the largest
bowlder shown on Fig. 17, and is pecked to the depth of from one-fourth to one-half
an inch. Portions of it are much defaced through erosion by sand blown by the
strong summer winds. The characters in <i>g</i> are only one-tenth of the original size,
but of depth similar to the preceding.</p>

<p>On Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span>, <i>a</i> is one-twentieth the size of the original, while the remaining sculpturings
are about one-tenth size. The cross in <i>a</i> is singularly interesting because of
the elaborateness of its execution. The surface within the circle is pecked out so
as to have the cross stand out bold and level with the original surface. This is true
also of <i>f</i> on Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span>. Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span>, <i>b</i>, contains some animal forms like those reported from
New Mexico and Arizona, and Brazil [and presented in this work], especially that
character to the right resembling a guanaco couchant, although, from its relationship
to the figure of an antelope, in the same group, it no doubt is intended to represent
one of the latter species.</p>

<p>On Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">X</span>, as well as on others of this collection, are found many forms of circles with
interior decoration, such as lines arranged by pairs, threes, etc., zigzag and cross
lines, and other seemingly endless arrangements. They are interesting from the fact
of the occurrence of almost identical forms in remote localities, as in the Canary
islands and in Brazil. [These are figured and described infra.]</p>

<p>It is probable that they are not meaningless, because the disposition of the Indian,
as he is to-day, is such that no time would be spent upon such laborious work without
an object, and only motives of a religious or ceremonial nature would induce
him to expend the time and labor necessary to accomplish such results as are still
presented. On Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span>, <i>a</i>, are more footprints and animal forms of the genus <i>cervus</i>
or <i>antelocapra</i>. The figures in <i>b</i> and <i>d</i>, having an upright line with two crossing it at
right angles, may signify either a lizard or man, the latter signification being probably
the true one, as similar forms are drawn in petroglyphs of a Shoshonian type,
as in Arizona. [See supra.]</p>

<p>The country over which these records are scattered is arid beyond description and
destitute of vegetation. Watterson’s ranch group is more favorably located, there
being an abundance of springs and a stream running northward toward Black lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page060" id="page060">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The only Indians found in this vicinity are Pai Utes, but they are unacquainted
with the significance of the characters, and declare that they have no knowledge of
the authors.</p>

<p>As to the age of the sculpturings nothing can be learned. The external surface of
all the bowlders, as well as the surface of the deepest figures, is a glistening brownish
black, due, possibly, to the presence of iron. The color of a freshly broken surface
becomes lighter in tint as depth is attained, until at about one-half or three-fourths
of an inch from the surface the rock is chocolate brown. How long it
would take the freshly broken surface of this variety of rock to become thoroughly
oxidized and blackened it is impossible even to conjecture, taking into consideration
the physical conditions of the region and the almost entire absence of rainfall.</p>

<p>Upon following the most convenient course across the Benton range to reach
Owen valley proper drawings are also found, though in limited numbers, and seem
to partake of the character of indicators as to course of travel. By this trail the
northernmost of the several groups of drawings above mentioned is the nearest and
most easily reached.</p>

<p>The pictures upon the bowlders at Watterson’s are somewhat different from those
found elsewhere. The number of specific designs is limited, many of them being
reproduced from two to six or seven times, thus seeming to partake of the character
of personal names.</p></div>

<p>In a communication dated Saratoga Springs, at the lower part of
Death valley, California, February 5, 1891, Mr. E. W. Nelson says that
about 200 yards from the springs, and on the side of a hill, he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="page061" id="page061">[61]</a></span>
several petroglyphs. He also furnished a sketch as an example of
their general type, now presented as Fig. 18. The locality is in the
lower end of Death valley. Mr. Nelson says:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The spring here is in a basin some 60 to 80 acres in extent in which are ponds
and tule marsh. Close by is an extensive ancient Indian camping ground, over which
are scattered very many “chips” made from manufacturing arrow points from
quartz crystal, chert, chalcedony, flint, and other similar material.</p>

<p>The figures in the sketch inclosed are situated relatively, as to size and location,
as they occur on the rock. The latter is cracked and slopes at different angles, but
the figures are all visible from a single point of view. There are several other
figures in this group that are too indistinct to copy owing to age, or weather wearing.
The group copied is the most extensive one seen, but many smaller groups and
single figures are to be found on the rocks near by.</p>

<p>The Shoshoni inhabit this region and a few families of Shoshoni live about the
Panamint mountains at present.</p></div>

<p>Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the Department of Agriculture, on his return
from the exploration of Death valley, kindly furnished a photograph
of a ledge in Emigrant canyon, Panamint mountains, which was received
too late for insertion in this work. This is much regretted, as a large
number of petroglyphs are represented in groups. The characters are
of the Shoshonean type. Among them are “Moki goats,” tridents, the
Greek Φ, many crosses, and other figures shown in this chapter as
found in the same general region.</p>

<p>In the Mojave desert, about 2 miles north of Daggett station, according
to the Mining and Scientific Press (<i>a</i>) is a small porphyritic butte
known as “Rattlesnake rock,” “so named by reason of the immense
number of these reptiles that find shelter in this mass of rock.” The
accompanying Fig. 19 is a reproduction of that given in the paper
quoted. The author states that “the implement used in making these
characters was evidently a dull-pointed stone, as the lines are not
sharp, and the sides of the indentation show marks of striation.”</p>

<p>Lieut. Whipple reports the discovery of pictographs at Piute creek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page062" id="page062">[62]</a></span>
about 30 miles west of the Mojave villages. These are carved upon a
rock, “are numerous, appear old, and are too confusedly obscured to
be easily traceable.” They bear great general resemblance to drawings
scattered over northeast Arizona, southern Utah, and western New
Mexico.</p>

<p>From information received from Mr. Alphonse Pinart, pictographic
records exist in the hills east of San Bernardino, somewhat resembling
those at Tule river in the southern spurs of the Sierra Nevada, Kern
county.</p>

<p>Mr. Willard J. Whitney, of Elmhurst, Lackawanna county, Pennsylvania,
gives information regarding nearly obliterated pecked petroglyphs
upon two flat granite rocks, or bowlders, on the summit of a
mountain 4 miles directly west of Escondido, San Diego county, California.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page063" id="page063">[63]</a></span>
The designs are not colored, and are not more than one-eighth
or one-fourth of an inch in depth. There is a good lookout from the
eminence, but there are no indications of either trails or burials in the
vicinity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page064" id="page064">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>This may be the locality mentioned by Mr. Barnes, of San Diego,
who furnished information relating to petroglyphs in San Diego county.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoffman reports the following additional localities in Santa Barbara
and Los Angeles counties. Fifteen miles west of Santa Barbara,
on the northern summit of the Santa Ynez range, and near the San
Marcos pass, is a group of paintings in red and black. Fig. 20 resembles
a portion of a checker-board in the arrangement of squares.</p>

<p>Serpentine and zigzag lines occur, as also curved lines with serrations
on the concave sides; figures of the sun; short lines and groups
of short parallel lines, and figures representing types of insect forms
also appear, as shown in Figs. 21 and 22.</p>

<p>These paintings are in a cavity near the base of an immense bowlder,
over 20 feet in height. A short distance from this is a flat granitic
bowlder, containing twenty-one mortar holes, which had evidently been
used by visiting Indians during the acorn season. Oaks are very
abundant, and their fruit formed one of the sources of subsistence.</p>

<p>Three miles west-northwest of this locality, in the valley near the
base of the mountain, are indistinct figures in faded red, painted upon a
large rock. The characters appear similar, in general, to those above
mentioned.</p>

<p>Forty-three miles west of Santa Barbara, in the Najowe valley, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page066" id="page066">[66]</a></span>
promontory, at the base of which is a large shallow cavern, the opening
being smaller than the interior, upon the roof and back of which are
many designs, some of which are reproduced in Fig. 23, of forms similar
to those observed at San Marcos pass. Several characters appear to
have been drawn at a later date than others, such as horned cattle, etc.
The black used was a manganese compound, while the red pigments<span class="pagenum"><a name="page067" id="page067">[67]</a></span>
consist of ferruginous clays, abundant at numerous localities in the
mountain canyons.</p>

<p>One of the most extensive groupings, and probably the most elaborately
drawn, is in the Carisa plain, near Mr. Oreña’s ranch, 60 or 70
miles due north of Santa Barbara. The most conspicuous figure is that
of the sun, resembling a human face, with ornamental appendages at the
cardinal points, and bearing striking resemblance to some Moki masks
and pictographic work. Serpentine lines and anomalous forms also
abound.</p>

<p>Four miles northeast of Santa Barbara, near the residence of Mr.
Stevens, is an isolated sandstone bowlder measuring about 20 feet high
and 30 feet in diameter, upon the western side of which is a slight
cavity bearing designs shown in Fig. 29, which correspond in general
form to others in Santa Barbara county. The gesture for negation appears
in the attitude of the human figures.</p>

<p>Half a mile farther east, on Dr. Coe’s farm, is another smaller bowlder,
in a cavity of which various engravings appear shown in Fig. 30.
Parts of the drawings have disappeared through disintegration of the
rock, which is called “Pulpit rock,” on account of the shape of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page069" id="page069">[69]</a></span>
cavity, its position at the side of the narrow valley, and the echo observed
upon speaking a little above the ordinary tone of voice.</p>

of Los Angeles, of which Fig. 31 gives copies.</p>

<p>Just before his departure from the Santa Barbara region, Dr. Hoffman
was informed of the existence of eight or nine painted records in that
neighborhood, which up to that time had been observed only by a few
sheep-herders and hunters.</p>

<p>Mr. L. L. Frost, of Susanville, California, reports the occurrence of
pictographs (undoubtedly petroglyphs) 15 miles south of that town, on
Willow creek, and at Milford, in the lower end of the valley. No details
were furnished as to their general type and condition.</p>

<p>On Porter creek, 9 miles southwest of Healdsburg, on a large bowlder
of hornblende syenite, petroglyphs similar to those found in Arizona
and Nevada are to be seen. They are generally oblong circles or ovals,
some of which contain crosses.</p>

<p>Figs. 32 and 33 are reduced copies 1/32 of original size of colored petroglyphs
found by Dr. Hoffman in September, 1884, 12 miles west-northwest
of the city of Santa Barbara, California. The locality is almost
at the summit of the Santa Ynez range of mountains; the gray sandstone<span class="pagenum"><a name="page070" id="page070">[70]</a></span>
rock on which they are painted is about 30 feet high and projects
from a ridge so as to form a very marked promontory extending
into a narrow mountain canyon. At the base of the western side of
this bowlder is a rounded cavity, measuring on the inside about 15
feet in width and 8 feet in height. The floor ascends rapidly toward
the back of the cave, and the entrance is rather smaller in dimensions
than the above measurements of the interior. About 40 yards
west of this rock is a fine spring of water. One of the four old Indian
trails leading northward across the mountains passes by this
locality, and it is probable that this was one of the camping places of
the tribe which came south to trade, and that some of its members
were the authors of the paintings. The three trails beside the one
just mentioned cross the mountains at several points east of this, the
most distant being about 15 miles. Other trails were known, but
these four were most direct to the immediate vicinity of the Spanish
settlement which sprang up shortly after the establishment of the Santa
Barbara mission in 1786. The appearance and position of these and
other pictographs in the vicinity appear to be connected with the several
trails. The colors used in the paintings are red and black.</p>

</div>

<p>The circles figured in <i>b</i> and <i>d</i> of Fig. 32, and <i>c</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>w</i> of Fig. 33,
together with other similar circular marks bearing cross lines upon the
interior, were at first unintelligible, as their forms among various tribes
have very different signification. The character in Fig. 32, above and
projecting from <i>d</i>, resembles the human form, with curious lateral bands
of black and white, alternately. Two similar characters appear, also,
in Fig. 33, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>. In <i>a</i> the lines from the head would seem to indicate a
superior rank or condition of the person depicted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page071" id="page071">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>At the private ethnologic collection of Mr. A. F. Coronel, of Los
Angeles, California, Dr. Hoffman discovered a clue to the general import
of the above petroglyphs, as well as the signification of some of their
characters. In a collection of colored illustrations of old Mexican costumes
he found blankets bearing borders and colors nearly identical
with those shown in the circles in Fig. 32, <i>d</i>, and Fig. 33, <i>c</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>w</i>. It is
probable that the circles represent bales of blankets which early became
articles of trade at the Santa Barbara mission. If this supposition
is correct, the cross lines would seem to represent the cords used
in tying the blankets into bales, which same cross lines appear as
cords in <i>l</i>, Fig. 33. Mr. Coronel also possesses small figures of Mexicans,
of various conditions of life, costumes, trades, and professions,
one of which, a painted statuette, is a representation of a Mexican
lying down flat upon an outspread serape, similar in color and form to
the black and white bands shown in the upper figure of <i>d</i>, Fig. 32, and
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, of Fig. 33, and instantly suggesting the explanation of those
figures. Upon the latter the continuity of the black and white bands
is broken, as the human figures are probably intended to be in front,
or on top, of the drawings of the blankets.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph in Santa Barbara county, California.</div>
</div>

<p>The small statuette above mentioned is that of a Mexican trader, and
if the circles in the petroglyphs are considered to represent bales of
blankets, the character in Fig. 32, <i>d</i>, is still more interesting, from the
union of one of these circles with a character representing the trader, i. e.,
the man possessing the bales. Bales, or what appear to be bales, are
represented to the top and right of the circle in <i>d</i>, in that figure. In
Fig. 33, <i>l</i>, a bale is upon the back of what appears to be a horse, led in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page072" id="page072">[72]</a></span>
an upward direction by an Indian whose headdress and ends of the
breechcloth are visible. To the right of the bale are three short lines,
evidently showing the knot or ends of the cords used in tying a bale of
blankets without colors, therefore of less importance, or of other goods.
Other human forms appear in the attitude of making gestures, one
also in <i>j</i>, Fig. 33, probably carrying a bale of goods. In the same
figure <i>u</i> represents a centipede, an insect found occasionally south of
the mountains, but reported as extremely rare in the immediate northern
regions. For remarks upon <i>x</i> in the same figure see Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XX</span>,
Section 2, under the heading <a href="#page724">The Cross</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Coronel stated that when he first settled in Los Angeles, in 1843,
the Indians living north of the San Fernando mountains manufactured
blankets of the fur and hair of animals, showing transverse bands of
black and white similar to those depicted, which were sold to the inhabitants
of the valley of Los Angeles and to Indians who transported
them to other tribes.</p>

<p>It is probable that the pictographs are intended to represent the salient
features of a trading expedition from the north. The ceiling of the
cavity found between the paintings represented in the two figures has
disappeared, owing to disintegration, thus leaving a blank about 4 feet
long, and 6 feet from the top to the bottom between the paintings as
now presented.</p>


<h4>COLORADO.</h4>

<p>Petroglyphs are reported by Mr. Cyrus F. Newcomb as found upon
cliffs on Rock creek, 15 miles from Rio Del Norte, Colorado. Three
small photographs, submitted with this statement, indicate the characters
to have been pecked; they consist of men on horseback, cross-shaped
human figures, animals, and other designs greatly resembling
those found in the country of the Shoshonean tribes, examples of which
are given infra.</p>

<p>Another notice of the same general locality is made by Capt. E. L.
Berthoud (<i>a</i>) as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The place is 20 miles southeast of Rio Del Norte, at the entrance of the canyon of the
Piedra Pintada (Painted rock) creek. The carvings are found on the right of the
canyon or valley and upon volcanic rocks. They bear the marks of age and are cut in,
not painted, as is still done by the Utes everywhere. They are found for a quarter
of a mile along the north wall of the canyon, on the ranches of W. M. Maguire
and F. T. Hudson, and consist of all manner of pictures, symbols, and hieroglyphics
done by artists whose memory even tradition does not now preserve. The fact that
these are carvings done upon such hard rock invests them with additional interest,
as they are quite distinct from the carvings I saw in New Mexico and Arizona on
soft sandstone. Though some of them are evidently of much greater antiquity than
others, yet all are ancient, the Utes admitting them to have been old when their
fathers conquered the country.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Charles D. Wright, of Durango, Colorado, in a communication
dated February 20, 1885, gives an account of some “hieroglyphs” on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page073" id="page073">[73]</a></span>
rocks and upon the walls of cliff houses near the boundary line between
Colorado and New Mexico. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The following were painted in red and black paints on the wall (apparently the
natural rock wall) of a cliff house: At the head was a chief on his horse, armed with
spear and lance and wearing a pointed hat and robe; behind this character were
some twenty characters representing people on horses lassoing horses, etc. In fact
the whole scene represented breaking camp and leaving in a hurry. The whole
painting measured about 12 by 16 feet.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Wright further reports characters on rocks near the San Juan
river. Four characters represent men as if in the act of taking an
obligation, hands extended, and wearing a “kind of monogram on
breast, and at their right are some hieroglyphics written in black paint
covering a space 3 by 4 feet.”</p>

<p>The best discussed and probably the most interesting of the petroglyphs
in the region are described and illustrated by Mr. W. H.
Holmes (<i>a</i>), of the Bureau of Ethnology. The illustrations are here
reproduced in Figs. 34 to 37, and the remarks of Mr. Holmes, slightly
condensed, are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The forms reproduced in Fig. 34 occur on the Rio Mancos, near the group of cliff
houses. They are chipped into the rock evidently by some very hard implement
and rudely represent the human figure. They are certainly not attempts to represent
nature, but have the appearance rather of arbitrary forms, designed to symbolize
some imaginary being.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs on the Rio Mancos, Colorado.</div>
</div>

<p>The forms shown in Fig. 35 were found in the same locality, not engraved, but
painted in red and white clay upon the smooth rocks. These were certainly done
by the cliff-builders, and probably while the houses were in process of construction,
since the material used is identical with the plaster of the houses. The sketches and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page074" id="page074">[74]</a></span>
notes were made by Mr. Brandegee. The reproduction is approximately one-twelfth
the size of the original.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs on the Rio Mancos, Colorado.</div>
</div>

<p>The examples shown in Fig. 36 occur on the Rio San Juan about 10 miles below
the mouth of the Rio La Plata and are actually in New Mexico. A low line of bluffs,
composed of light-colored massive sandstones that break down in great smooth-faced
blocks, rises from the river level and sweeps around toward the north. Each of
these great blocks has offered a very tempting tablet to the graver of the primitive
artist, and many of them contain curious and interesting inscriptions. Drawings
were made of such of these as the limited time at my disposal would permit. They
are all engraved or cut into the face of the rock, and the whole body of each figure
has generally been chipped out, frequently to the depth of one-fourth or one-half of
an inch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs on the Rio San Juan, New Mexico.</div>
</div>

<p>The work on some of the larger groups has been one of immense labor, and must
owe its completion to strong and enduring motives. With a very few exceptions
the engraving bears undoubted evidence of age. Such new figures as occur are
quite easily distinguished both by the freshness of the chipped surfaces and by the
designs themselves. The curious designs given in the final group have a very perceptible
resemblance to many of the figures used in the embellishment of pottery.</p>

<p>The most striking group observed is given in Fig. 37 <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, same locality. It consists
of a great procession of men, birds, beasts, and fanciful figures. The whole picture
as placed upon a rock is highly spirited and the idea of a general movement toward
the right, skillfully portrayed. A pair of winged figures hover about the train as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="page075" id="page075">[75]</a></span>
to watch, or direct its movements; behind these are a number of odd figures, followed
by an antlered animal resembling a deer, which seems to be drawing a notched
sledge containing two figures of men. The figures forming the main body of the
procession appear to be tied together in a continuous line, and in form resemble one
living creature about as little as another. Many of the smaller figures above and
below are certainly intended to represent dogs, while a number of men are stationed
about here and there as if to keep the procession in order.</p>

</div>

<p>As to the importance of the event recorded in this picture, no conclusions can be
drawn; it may represent the migration of a tribe or family or the trophies of a victory.
A number of figures are wanting in the drawing at the left, while some of
those at the right may not belong properly to the main group. The reduction is,
approximately, to one-twelfth.</p>

<p>Designs B and C of the same figure represent only the more distinct portions of
two other groups. The complication of figures is so great that a number of hours
would have been necessary for their delineation, and an attempt to analyze them
here would be fruitless.</p></div>

<p>It will be noticed that the last two petroglyphs are in New Mexico, but
they are so near the border of Colorado and so connected with the
series in that state that they are presented under the same heading.</p>


<h4>CONNECTICUT.</h4>

<p>The following account is extracted from Rafn’s Antiquitates Americanæ
(<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the year 1789 Doctor Ezra Stiles, D. D., visited a rock situated in the Township
of Kent in the State of Connecticut, at a place called Scaticook, by the Indians.
He thus describes it: “Over against Scaticook and about one hundred rods East of
Housatonic River, is an eminence or elevation which is called Cobble Hill. On the
top of this stands the rock charged with antique unknown characters. This rock is
by itself and not a portion of the Mountains; it is of White Flint; ranges North and
South; is from twelve to fourteen feet long; and from eight to ten wide at base and
top; and of an uneven surface. On the top I did not perceive any characters; but
the sides all around are irregularly charged with unknown characters, made not
indeed with the incision of a chisel, yet most certainly with an iron tool, and that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page076" id="page076">[76]</a></span>
pecks or picking, after the manner of the Dighton Rock. The Lacunae or excavations
are from a quarter to an inch wide; and from one tenth to two tenths of an
inch deep. The engraving did not appear to be recent or new, but very old.”</p></div>


<h4>GEORGIA.</h4>

<p>Charles C. Jones, jr., (<i>a</i>) describes a petroglyph in Georgia as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Forsyth county, Georgia, is a carved or incised bowlder of fine grained granite,
about 9 feet long, 4 feet 6 inches high, and 3 feet broad at its widest point. The
figures are cut in the bowlder from one-half to three-fourths of an inch deep. It is
generally believed that they are the work of the Cherokees.</p></div>

<p>The illustration given by him is here reproduced in Fig. 38. It will be
noted that the characters in it are chiefly circles, including plain, nucleated,
and concentric, sometimes two or more being joined by straight
lines, forming what is now known as the “spectacle shaped” figure.
The illustrations should be compared with the many others presented
in this paper under the heading of Cup Sculptures, see Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page189">V</a></span>, infra.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp130_pg076h.png">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in Georgia.</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. M. F. Stephenson (<i>a</i>) mentions sculptures of human feet, various
animals, bear tracks, etc., in Enchanted mountain, Union county, Georgia.
The whole number of sculptures is reported as one hundred and
forty-six.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones (<i>b</i>) gives a different résumé of the objects depicted, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Upon the Enchanted mountain, in Union county, cut in plutonic rock, are the tracks
of men, women, children, deer, bears, bisons, turkeys, and terrapins, and the outlines
of a snake, of two deer, and of a human hand. These sculptures&mdash;so far as they
have been ascertained and counted&mdash;number one hundred and thirty-six. The most
extravagant among them is that known as the footprint of the “Great Warrior.”
It measures 18 inches in length and has six toes. The other human tracks and those
of the animals are delineated with commendable fidelity.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page077" id="page077">[77]</a></span></p>


<h4>IDAHO.</h4>

<p>Mr. G. K. Gilbert, of the U. S. Geological Survey, has furnished a
small collection of drawings of Shoshonean petroglyphs from Oneida,
Idaho, shown in Fig. 39. Some of them appear to be totemic characters,
and possibly were made to record the names of visitors to the
locality.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in Idaho (Shoshonean).</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Willard D. Johnson, of the U. S. Geological Survey, reports
pictographic remains observed by him near Oneida, Idaho, in 1879.
The figures represent human beings and were on a rock of basalt.</p>

<p>A copy of another petroglyph found in Idaho appears in Fig. <a href="#page680">1092</a>,
infra.</p>


<h4>ILLINOIS.</h4>

<p>Petroglyphs are reported by Mr. John Criley as occurring near Ava,
Jackson county, Illinois. The outlines of the characters observed by
him were drawn from memory and submitted to Mr. Charles S. Mason,
of Toledo, Ohio, through whom they were furnished to the Bureau of
Ethnology. Little reliance can be placed upon the accuracy of such
drawing, but from the general appearance of the sketches the originals
of which they are copies were probably made by one of the middle Algonquian
tribes of Indians.</p>

<p>The “Piasa” rock, as it is generally designated, was referred to by
the missionary explorer Marquette in 1675. Its situation was immediately
above the city of Alton, Illinois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page078" id="page078">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Marquette’s remarks are translated by Dr. Francis Parkman (<i>a</i>) as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the flat face of a high rock were painted, in red, black, and green, a pair of
monsters, each “as large as a calf, with horns like a deer, red eyes, a beard like
a tiger, and a frightful expression of countenance. The face is something like that
of a man, the body covered with scales; and the tail so long that it passes entirely
round the body, over the head, and between the legs, ending like that of a fish.”</p></div>

<p>Another version, by Davidson and Struvé (<i>a</i>), of the discovery of
the petroglyph is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Again they (Joliet and Marquette) were floating on the broad bosom of the unknown
stream. Passing the mouth of the Illinois, they soon fell into the shadow of
a tall promontory, and with great astonishment beheld the representation of two
monsters painted on its lofty limestone front. According to Marquette, each of these
frightful figures had the face of a man, the horns of a deer, the beard of a tiger, and
the tail of a fish so long that it passed around the body, over the head, and between
the legs. It was an object of Indian worship and greatly impressed the mind of the
pious missionary with the necessity of substituting for this monstrous idolatry the
worship of the true God.</p></div>

<p>A footnote connected with the foregoing quotation gives the following
description of the same rock:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Near the mouth of the Piasa creek, on the bluff, there is a smooth rock in a cavernous
cleft, under an overhanging cliff, on whose face, 50 feet from the base, are
painted some ancient pictures or hieroglyphics, of great interest to the curious.
They are placed in a horizontal line from east to west, representing men, plants, and
animals. The paintings, though protected from dampness and storms, are in great
part destroyed, marred by portions of the rock becoming detached and falling down.</p></div>

<p>Mr. McAdams (<i>a</i>), of Alton, Illinois, says “The name Piasa is Indian
and signifies, in the Illini, ‘The bird which devours men.’” He furnishes
a spirited pen-and-ink sketch, 12 by 15 inches in size and purporting
to represent the ancient painting described by Marquette. On
the picture is inscribed the following in ink: “Made by Wm. Dennis,
April 3d, 1825.” The date is in both letters and figures. On the top
of the picture in large letters are the two words, “FLYING DRAGON.”
This picture, which has been kept in the old Gilham family of Madison
county and bears the evidence of its age, is reproduced as Fig. 40.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>&mdash;The Piasa petroglyph.</div>
</div>

<p>He also publishes another representation (Fig. 41) with the following
remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of the most satisfactory pictures of the Piasa we have ever seen is in an old
German publication entitled “The Valley of the Mississippi Illustrated. Eighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="page079" id="page079">[79]</a></span>
illustrations from nature, by H. Lewis, from the Falls of St. Anthony to the Gulf of
Mexico,” published about the year 1839 by Arenz &amp; Co., Düsseldorf, Germany. One
of the large full-page plates in this work gives a fine view of the bluff at Alton, with
the figure of the Piasa on the face of the rock. It is represented to have been taken
on the spot by artists from Germany. We reproduce that part of the bluff (the
whole picture being too large for this work) which shows the pictographs. In the
German picture there is shown just behind the rather dim outlines of the second
face a ragged crevice, as though of a fracture. Part of the bluff’s face might have
fallen and thus nearly destroyed one of the monsters, for in later years writers
speak of but one figure. The whole face of the bluff was quarried away in 1846-’47.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>&mdash;The Piasa petroglyph.</div>
</div>

<p>Under Myths and Mythic Animals, Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV</span>, Section <a href="#page468">2</a>, are illustrations
and descriptions which should be compared with these accounts,
and Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page759">XXII</a></span> gives other examples of errors and discrepancies in
the description and copying of petroglyphs.</p>

<p>Mr. A. D. Jones (<i>a</i>) says of the same petroglyph:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After the distribution of firearms among the Indians, bullets were substituted for
arrows, and even to this day no savage presumes to pass the spot without discharging
his rifle and raising his shout of triumph. I visited the spot in June (1838) and
examined the image and the ten thousand bullet marks on the cliff seemed to corroborate
the tradition related to me in the neighborhood.</p></div>

<p>Mr. McAdams, loc. cit., also reports regarding Fig. 42:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph on the Illinois river.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some twenty-five or thirty miles above the mouth of the Illinois river, on the west
bank of that stream, high up on the smooth face of an overhanging cliff, is another
interesting pictograph sculptured deeply in the hard rock. It remains to-day probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="page080" id="page080">[80]</a></span>
in nearly the same condition it was when the French voyagers first descended
the river and got their first view of the Mississippi. The animal-like body, with the
human head, is carved in the rock in outline. The huge eyes are depressions like
saucers, an inch or more in depth, and the outline of the body has been scooped out
in the same way; also the mouth.</p>

<p>The figure of the archer with the drawn bow, however, is painted, or rather
stained with a reddish brown pigment, over the sculptured outline of the monster’s
face.</p></div>

<p>Mr. McAdams suggests that the painted figure of the human form
with the bow and arrows was made later than the sculpture.</p>

<p>The same author (<i>b</i>) says, describing Fig. 43:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph near Alton, Illinois.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some 3 or 4 miles above Alton, high up beneath the overhanging cliff, which forms
a sort of cave shelter on the smooth face of a thick ledge of rock, is a series of paintings,
twelve in number. They are painted or rather stained in the rock with a
reddish brown pigment that seems to defy the tooth of time. It may be said,
however, that their position is so sheltered that they remain almost perfectly dry.
We made sketches of them some thirty years ago and on a recent visit could see that
they had changed but little, although their appearance denotes great age.</p>

<p>These pictographs are situated on the cliff more than a hundred feet above the
river. A protruding ledge, which is easily reached from a hollow in the bluff, leads
to the cavernous place in the rock.</p></div>

<p>Mr. James D. Middleton, formerly of the Bureau of Ethnology,
mentions the occurrence of petroglyphs on the bluffs of the Mississippi
river, in Jackson county, about 12 miles below Rockwood. Also of
others about 4 or 5 miles from Prairie du Rocher, near the Mississippi
river.</p>


<h4>IOWA.</h4>

<p>Mr. P. W. Norris, of the Bureau of Ethnology, found numerous caves
on the banks of the Mississippi river, in northeastern Iowa, 4 miles
south of New Albion, containing incised petroglyphs. Fifteen miles
south of this locality paintings occur on the cliffs. He also discovered
painted characters upon the cliffs on the Mississippi river, 19 miles below
New Albion.</p>


<h4>KANSAS.</h4>

<p>Mr. Edward Miller reports in Proceedings of the American Philosophical
Society, vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">X</span>, 1869, p. 383, the discovery of a petroglyph near
the line of the Union Pacific railroad, 15 miles southeast of Fort Harker,
formerly known as Fort Ellsworth, Kansas. The petroglyph is upon
a formation belonging to No. 1, Lower Cretaceous group, according to
the classification of Meek and Hayden.</p>

<h4>KENTUCKY.</h4>

<p>Mr. James D. Middleton, formerly of the Bureau of Ethnology, in
a letter dated August 14, 1886, reports that at a point in Union
county, Kentucky, nearly opposite Shawneetown, Illinois, petroglyphs
are found, and from the description given by him they appear to resemble
those in Jackson county, Illinois, mentioned above.</p>

<p>Mr. W. E. Barton, of Wellington, Ohio, in a communication dated
October 4, 1890, writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At Clover Bottom, Kentucky, on a spur of the Big Hill, in Jackson county, about
13 miles from Berea, is a large rock which old settlers say was covered with soil and
vegetation within their memory. Upon it are representations of human tracks, with
what appear to be those of a bear, a horse, and a dog. These are all in the same
direction, as though a man leading a horse, followed the dog upon the bear’s track.
Crossing these is a series of tracks of another and larger sort which I can not attempt
to identify. The stone is a sandstone in the subcarboniferous. As I remember, the
strata are nearly horizontal, but erosion has made the surface a slope of about 20°.
The tracks ascending the slope cross the strata. I have not seen them for some years.</p>

<p>The crossing of the strata shows that the tracks are the work of human hands, if
indeed it were not preposterous to think of anything else in rocks of that period.
Still the tracks are so well made that one is tempted to ask if they can be real.
They alternate right and left, though the erosion and travel have worn out some of
the left tracks. A wagon road passes over the rock and was the cause of the present
exposure of the stone. It can be readily found a fourth of a mile or less from the
Pine Grove schoolhouse.</p></div>


<h4>MAINE.</h4>

<p>A number of inscribed rocks have been found in Maine and information
of others has been obtained. The most interesting of them and
the largest group series yet discovered in New England is shown in
Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XII</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption">BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY TENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XII<br />PETROGLYPHS IN MAINE.</div>
</div>

<p>The rock upon which the glyphs appear is in the town of Machiasport,
Maine, at Clarks point, on the northwestern side of Machias bay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page082" id="page082">[82]</a></span>
2 miles below the mouth of Machias river. The rock or ledge is about
50 feet long from east to west and about fifteen feet in width, nearly
horizontal for two-thirds its length, from the bank or western end at
high water, thence inclining at an angle of 15° to low-water mark. Its
southern face is inclined about 40°. The formation is schistose slate,
having a transverse vein of trap dike extending nearly across its section.
Nearly the entire ledge is of blue-black color, very dense and
hard except at the upper or western end, where the periodical formation
of ice has scaled off thin layers of surface and destroyed many
figures which are remembered by persons now living. The ebb and
flow of tides, the abrasion of moving beach stones or pebble wash and
of ice-worn bowlders, have also effaced many figures along the southern
side, until now but one or two indentations are discernible. Visitors, in
seeking to remove some portion of the rock as a curiosity or in striving
to perpetuate their initials, have obscured several of the most interesting,
and until recently the best defined figures. It was also evident to
the present writer, who carefully examined the rock in 1888, that it lay
much deeper in the water than once had been the case. At the lowest
tides there were markings seen still lower, which could not readily have
been made if that part of the surface had not been continuously exposed.
The depression of a rock of such great size, which was so
gradual that it had not been observed by the inhabitants of the neighboring
settlement, is an evidence of the antiquity of the peckings.</p>

<p>The intaglio carving of all the figures was apparently made by
repeated blows of a pointed instrument&mdash;doubtless of hard stone; not
held as a chisel, but working by a repetition of hammerings or peckings.
The deepest now seen is about three-eighths of an inch.
The amount of patient labor bestowed upon these figures must have
been great, considering the hardness of the rock and the rude implement
with which they were wrought.</p>

<p>There is no extrinsic evidence of their age. The place was known
to traders early in the seventeenth century, and much earlier was
visited by Basque fishermen, and perhaps by the unfortunate Cortereals
in 1500 and 1503. The descendants of the Mechises Indians, a tribal
branch of the Abnaki, who once occupied the territory between the St.
Croix and Narraguagus rivers, when questioned many years ago, would
reply in substance that “all their old men knew of them,” either by
having seen them or by traditions handed down through many generations.</p>

<p>Several years ago Mr. H. R. Taylor, of Machias, who made the original
sketch in 1868 and kindly furnished it to the Bureau of Ethnology,
applied to a resident Indian there (Peter Benoit, then nearly 80
years old) for assistance in deciphering the characters. He gave little
information, but pointed out that the figures must not all be read “from
one side only,” thus, the one near the center of the sketch, which seen
from the south was without significance, became from the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="page083" id="page083">[83]</a></span>
point a squaw with sea fowl on her head, denoting, as he said, “that
squaw had smashed canoe, saved beaver-skin, walked one-half moon
all alone toward east, just same as heron wading alongshore.” Also
that the three lines below the figure mentioned, which together resemble
a bird track or a trident, represent the three rivers, the East,
West, and Middle rivers of Machias, which join not far above the
locality. The mark having a rough resemblance to a feather, next on
the right of this river-sign, is a fissure in the rock. Most of the figures
of human beings and other animals are easily recognizable.</p>

<p>Peckings of a character similar to those on the Picture rock at
Clarks point, above described, were found and copied 600 feet south of
it at high-water mark on a rock near Birch point. Others were discovered
and traced on a rock on Hog island, in Holmes bay, a part of
Machias bay. All these petroglyphs were without doubt of Abnaki
origin, either of the Penobscot or the Passamaquoddy divisions of that
body of Indians. The rocks lay on the common line of water communication
between those divisions and were convenient as halting
places.</p>


<h4>MARYLAND.</h4>

<p>In the Susquehanna river, about half a mile south of the state line,
is a group of rocks, several of the most conspicuous being designated
as the “Bald Friars.” Near by are several mound-shaped bowlders
of the so-called “nigger-head” rock, which is reported as a dark-greenish
chlorite schist. Upon the several bowlders are deep sculpturings,
apparently finished by rubbing the depression with stone, or
wood and sand, thus leaving sharp and distinct edges to the outlines.
Some of these figures are an inch in depth, though the greater number
are becoming more and more eroded by the frequent freshets, and by
the running ice during the breaking up in early spring of the frozen
river.</p>

<p>The following account is given by Prof. P. Frazer (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Passing the Pennsylvania state line one reaches the southern barren serpentine
rocks, which are in general tolerably level for a considerable distance.</p>

<p>About 700 yards, or 640 meters, south of the line, on the river shore, are rocks which
have been named the Bald Friars. French’s tavern is here, at the mouth of a small
stream which empties into the Susquehanna. About 874 yards (800 meters) south
of this tavern are a number of islands which have local names, but which are curious
as containing inscriptions of the aborigines.</p>

<p>The material of which most of these islands are composed is chlorite schist, but
as this rock is almost always distinguished by the quartz veins which intersect it,
so in this case some of the islands are composed of this material almost exclusively,
which gives them a very striking white appearance.</p>

<p>One of these, containing the principal inscriptions, is called Miles island.</p>

<p>The figures, which covered every part of the rocks that were exposed, were apparently
of historical or at least narrative purport, since they seemed to be connected.
Doubtless the larger portion of the inscription has been carried away by
the successive vicissitudes which have broken up and defaced, and in some instances
obliterated, parts of which we find evidence of the previous existence on the islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page084" id="page084">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Every large bowlder seems to contain some traces of previous inscription, and in
many instances the pictured side of the bowlder is on its under side, showing that
it has been detached from its original place. The natural agencies are quite sufficient
to account for any amount of this kind of displacement, for the rocks in their
present condition are not refractory and offer no great resistance to the wear of
weather and ice; but in addition to this must be added human agencies.</p>

<p>Amongst other things, they represent the conventional Indian serpent’s head, with
varying numbers of lines.</p>

<p>Some of the signs next frequently recurring were concentric circles, in some cases
four and in other cases a lesser number.</p></div>

<p>During the autumn of the years 1888 and 1889 Dr. Hoffman visited
these rocks, securing sketches and measurements, the former of which
are reproduced in Figs. 47 and 48. The figures are deeply cut, as if
rubbed down with sand and a round stick of green wood. The deepest
channels, varying from three-fourths to 1&frac14; inches across and almost as
deep as they are wide, appear as if cut out with a gouge, and for this
reason bear a strong resemblance to the petroglyphs in Owens valley,
California. In whatever manner these sculpturings were made, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page085" id="page085">[85]</a></span>
evident that much time and great labor were expended upon them, as
this variety of rock, locally termed “Nigger-head,” is extremely hard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>&mdash;Top of Bald Friar rock, Maryland.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 45 represents a bird’s-eye
view of the top of the rock, bearing
the greater amount of workmanship.
The petroglyphs cover a surface
measuring about 5 feet by 4 feet 6
inches. The extreme ends of the
figures extend beyond the irregular
horizontal surface and project over
the rounded edge of the rock, so
that the line, at the left-hand lower
part of the illustration, dips at an
angle of about 45°. The two short
lines at the extreme right are upon
the side of the upper edge of the
rock, where the surface inclines at
an angle of 30°.</p>

<p>Some of the figures are indefinite,
which is readily accounted for by
the fact that the rock is in the river,
a considerable distance from shore,
and annually subjected to freshets
and to erosion by floating logs and drift material. The characters at
the right end of the upper row resemble those near Washington, Lancaster
county, Pennsylvania. (See Fig. <a href="#page109">73</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page086" id="page086">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 48 presents three characters, selected from other portions of the
rock, to illustrate the variety of designs found. They are like some
found at Owens valley, California, as will be observed by comparing
them with the descriptions and plates under that heading in this section.
The left-hand figure is 4 inches in diameter, the middle one 6
inches wide and about 15 inches in height, and the third, or right-hand,
is composed of concentric rings, measuring about 10 inches across.</p>

<h4>MASSACHUSETTS.</h4>

<p>The following description of the much-discussed Dighton rock is

<p>The ancient inscription on a bowlder of greenstone rock lying in the margin of
the Assonet or Taunton river, in the area of ancient Vinland, was noticed by the
New England colonists so early as 1680, when Dr. Danforth made a drawing of it.
This outline, together with several subsequent copies of it, at different eras, reaching
to 1830, all differing considerably in their details, but preserving a certain general
resemblance, is presented in the Antiquatés Americanes [<i>sic</i>] (Tables XI, XII),
and referred to the same era of Scandinavian discovery. The imperfections of the
drawings (including that executed under the auspices of the Rhode Island Historical
Society in 1839, Table XII), and the recognition of some characters bearing more or
less resemblance to antique Roman letters and figures, may be considered to have
misled Mr. Magnusen in his interpretation of it. From whatever cause, nothing
could, it would seem, have been wider from the purport and true interpretation of
it. It is of purely Indian origin, and is executed in the peculiar symbolic character
of the Kekeewin.</p></div>

<p>A number of copies of the inscriptions on this rock, taken at different
times by different persons, are given below in Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XXII</span>, sec. <a href="#page762">2</a>,
with remarks upon them.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoffman visited the locality in 1886, and found that the surface
was becoming rapidly destroyed from the frequent use of scrubbing
with broom and water to remove the film of sand and dirt which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page087" id="page087">[87]</a></span>
daily deposited by every tide, the rock being situated at a short distance
inshore. Visitors are frequent, and the guide or ferryman does
not interfere with them so long as he can show his passengers the
famous inscription.</p>

<p>The resemblance between the characters on this rock and those found
in western Pennsylvania, near Millsboro, Fig. <a href="#page111">75</a>, and south of Franklin,
on the “Indian God rock,” Fig. 74, will be noted.</p>

<p>In Rafn’s Antiq. Amer. (<i>b</i>) is the following account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A large stone, on which is a line of considerable length in unknown characters,
has been recently found in Rutland, Worcester county, Massachusetts; they are
regularly placed, and the strokes are filled with a black composition nearly as hard
as the rock itself. The Committee also adds that a similar rock is to be found in
Swanzy, county of Bristol and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, perhaps ten miles
from the Dighton Rock.</p></div>


<h4>MINNESOTA.</h4>

<p>The late Mr. P. W. Norris, who was connected with the Bureau of
Ethnology, reported large numbers of pecked totemic characters on the
horizontal faces of the ledges of rock at Pipestone quarry in Minnesota,
and presented some imitations of the peckings. There is a tradition
that it was formerly the custom for each Indian who gathered stone
(catlinite) for pipes, to inscribe his totem (whether clan or tribal or
personal totem is not specified) upon the rock before venturing to
quarry upon this ground. Some of the cliffs in the immediate vicinity
were of too hard a nature to admit of pecking or scratching, and upon
these the characters were placed in colors. Mr. Norris distinguished
bird tracks, the outline of a bird resembling a pelican, deer, turtle, a
circle with an interior cross, and a human figure.</p>

<p>Examples of so-called totemic designs from this locality are given in
Fig. 50, which are reproduced from the work of R. Cronau (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 331px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs at Pipestone, Minn.</div>
</div>


<p>The same petroglyphs and also others at the Pipestone quarry are
described and illustrated by Prof. N. H. Winchell (<i>a</i>). A part of his
remarks is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the glaciated surface of the quartzite about the “Three Maidens,” which is
kept clean by the rebound of the winds, are a great many rude inscriptions, which
were made by pecking out the rock with some sharp-pointed instrument or by the
use of other pieces of quartzite. They are of different sizes and dates, the latter
being evinced by their manner of crossing and interfering and by the evident difference
in the weight of the instruments used. They generally represent some animal,
such as the turtle, bear, wolf, buffalo, elk, and the human form. The “crane’s foot”
is the most common; next is the image of men; next the turtle. It would seem as if
any warrior or hunter who had been successful and happened to pass here left his
tribute of thanks to the great spirit in a rude representation of his game and perhaps
a figure of himself on the rocks about these bowlders, or perhaps had in a similar
way invoked the good offices of the spirits of his clan when about to enter on some
expedition. In some cases there is a connection of several figures by a continuous
line, chipped in the surface of the rock in such a manner as if some legend or adventure
were narrated, but for the most part the figures are isolated. This is the “sacred
ground” of the locality. Such markings can be seen at no other place, though there
is abundance of bare, smooth rock. (Similar inscriptions are found on the red<span class="pagenum"><a name="page088" id="page088">[88]</a></span>
quartzite in Cottonwood county). The excavation of the surface of the rock is very
slight, generally not exceeding a sixteenth of an inch, and sometimes only enough
to leave a tracing of the designed form. The hardness of the rock was a barrier to
deep sculpturing with the imperfect instruments of the aborigines; but it has effectually
preserved the rude forms that were made. The fine glacial scratches that are
abundantly scattered over this quartzite indicate the tenacity with which it retains
all such impressions, and will warrant the assignment of any date to these inscriptions
that may be called for within the human period. Yet it is probable that
they date back to no very great antiquity. They pertain, at least, to the dynasty
of the present Indian tribes. The totems of the turtle and the bear, which are
known to have been powerful among the clans of the native races in America at the
time of the earliest European knowledge of them, and which exist to this day, are
the most frequent objects represented. The “crane’s foot,” or “turkey foot,” or
“bird track,” terms which refer perhaps to the same totem sign&mdash;the snipe&mdash;is not
only common on these rocks, but is seen among the rock inscriptions of Ohio, and
was one of the totems of the Iroquois, of New York.</p></div>
<p>In June, 1892, Mr. W. H. Holmes, of the Bureau of Ethnology, visited
the Pipestone quarry and took a number of tracings of the petroglyphs,
which unfortunately were received too late for insertion in the present
work. Some of his remarks are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The trouble with the figures copied and published by Prof. Winchell is that they
are not arranged in the original order. It will now be impossible to correct this
entirely, as most of the stones have been taken up and removed. * * * The Winchell
drawings were evidently drawn by eye and have a very large personal equation;
besides, they are mixed up while appearing to be in some order. The few
groups that I was able to get are, it seems to me, of more interest than all the single
figures you could put in a book. There can be little doubt that in the main this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page089" id="page089">[89]</a></span>
great group of pictures was arranged in definite order, agreeing with the arrangements
of mythical personages and positions usual in the aboriginal ceremonials of
the region. It is a great pity that the original order has been destroyed, but the
inroads of relic hunters and inscription cranks made it necessary to take up the
stones. One large stone was taken to Minneapolis by Prof. Winchell. There are a
few pieces still in place. All were near the base of one of the great granite bowlders,
and it is said here that formerly, within the memory of the living, the place was
visited by Indians who wished to consult the gods.</p></div>

<p>The following description is extracted from the account of Mr. James
W. Lynd (<i>b</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Numerous high bluffs and cliffs surround it; the Pipestone quarry and the alluvial
flat below these, in which the quarry is situated, contains a huge bowlder that rests
upon a flat rock of glistening, smooth appearance, the level of which is but a few
inches above the surface of the ground. Upon the portions of this rock not covered
by the bowlder above and upon bowlder itself are carved sundry wonderful figures&mdash;lizards,
snakes, otters, Indian gods, rabbits with cloven feet, muskrats with human
feet, and other strange and incomprehensible things&mdash;all cut into the solid granite,
and not without a great deal of time and labor expended in the performance. * * *</p>

<p>A large party of Ehanktonwanna and Teetonwan Dakotas, says the legend, had
gathered together at the quarry to dig the stone. Upon a sultry evening, just before
sunset, the heavens suddenly became overclouded by a heavy rumbling thunder and
every sign of an approaching storm, such as frequently arises on the prairie without<span class="pagenum"><a name="page090" id="page090">[90]</a></span>
much warning. Each one hurried to his lodge, expecting a storm, when a vivid flash
of lightning, followed immediately by a crashing peal of thunder, broke over them,
and, looking towards the huge bowlder beyond their camp, they saw a pillar or
column of smoke standing upon it, which moved to and fro, and gradually settled
down into the outline of a huge giant, seated upon the bowlder, with one long arm
extended to heaven and the other pointing down to his feet. Peal after peal of
thunder, and flashes of lightning in quick succession followed, and this figure then
suddenly disappeared. The next morning the Sioux went to this bowlder and found
these figures and images upon it, where before there had been nothing, and ever
since that the place has been regarded as wakan or sacred.</p></div>

<p>Mr. T. H. Lewis (<i>b</i>) gives a description of Fig. 51.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This bowlder is in the edge of the public park, on the north end of the plateau at
Brown’s valley, Minnesota. The bowlder has a flat surface with a western exposure,
is irregular in outline, and is about 5 feet 8 inches in diameter, and firmly imbedded
in the terrace.</p>

<p>The central figure, <i>a</i>, undoubtedly represents a man, although the form is somewhat
conventional; <i>b</i> represents a bird; <i>c</i> represents a tortoise; <i>d</i> is a cross and
circle combined, but the circle has a groove extending from it; <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, and <i>g</i>, although
somewhat in the shape of crosses, probably represent bird tracks; <i>h</i> and <i>i</i> are nondescript
in character, although there must be some meaning attached to them; <i>k</i>
and <i>l</i> are small dots or cups cut into the bowlder.</p>

<p>The figures as illustrated are one-eighth of their natural size, and are also correct
in their relative positions one to the other. The work is neatly done although the
depth of the incisions is very slight.</p></div>


<h4>MONTANA.</h4>

<p>Mr. Charles Hallock, of Washington, D. C., reports the occurrence
of pictured rocks near Fort Assiniboin, Montana, but does not mention
whether they are colored or incised, and also fails to describe the general
type of the characters found.</p>


<h4>NEBRASKA.</h4>

<p>The following (condensed) description of petroglyphs found in Dakota
county, Nebraska, is furnished by Mr. J. H. Quick, of Sioux City, Iowa:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The petroglyphs are found upon the face of a sandstone cliff in a deep ravine at a
point where two watercourses (dry for the most part), meet about 20 miles south of
Sioux City, Iowa, but in Dakota county, in the State of Nebraska. At this point the
range of bluffs which bounds the Missouri river bottom is deeply cut through by the
above-mentioned ravine, which runs in a northerly direction towards the Missouri.
Another ravine coming from the southwest leaves this narrow point of land between
the two ravines, rising to a height of 50 to 75 feet above the bottom of the ravines.
For some distance from the point this cape, if I may so term it, shows ledges of
sandstone cropping out on both sides. And exactly at the point and for some rods
back on the east side are found the pictographs under consideration.</p>

<p>The rocks are of two kinds, a few feet of hard jasperous sandstone superimposed
on about the same thickness of sandstone so soft that it can be crumbled to pieces in the
fingers. The lower soft strata have been worn away, leaving the upper harder layers
jutting out to a distance of several feet over and completely sheltering them. And
on the smooth surface of these lower soft strata, protected by the overhanging ledge
above, shut in by bluffs 200 feet high on the east and sheltered from the winds by
dense underwood and scrubby forest trees, are carved these pictographs. These
safeguards, combined with the advantage of a very secluded situation, have combined
to preserve them, very little marred by careless and mischievous hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page091" id="page091">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The eagle or “thunder-bird” figures are quite numerous. There are also many of
the “buffalo track” and of the “turkey track” figures. I call them “turkey tracks”
because they all show a spur and seem to represent some of the large <i>gallinaciæ</i>.</p>

<p>In one of the groups, which I will call the “bear-fight group,” we are at a loss to
determine whether the figure of the small animal was a part of the original design
or a subsequent interpolation. It seemed genuine, but was not so deeply carved as
the other figures. The same may be said of the diagonal bars across the figure of
the bear.</p>

<p>In the other group, which I will term the “turkey-track group,” there are some
figures of which we could not even imagine the meaning. But they are undoubtedly
genuine, and seem to belong to the same design as the other figure.</p>

<p>The “bear-track” figures are very numerous and of several different sizes. A cat-like
figure, which we call a panther, shows faintly. It is about effaced by time.
Other figures reminded us of a crab or crawfish, but we were unable to determine
whether the line running back just below belongs to it or not.</p>

<p>I am informed by the same gentleman who saw these petroglyphs in 1857 that there
were at one time many more some 3 or 4 miles from this place, near Homer, Nebraska,
in the vicinity of a large spring, but he also said that as it is a favorite picnic
ground for the country people the carvings are probably destroyed. I presume
others may be found in these bluffs.</p>

<p>I surmise that the almost cave-like nature of the place where the carvings I have
above attempted to describe are situated rendered it a favorite camping ground and
resting place; and also that the ravines above mentioned made easy trails from the
Missouri bottom up to the higher grounds farther from the river, because it obviated
the ascent of the very steep bluffs.</p>

<p>The Winnebago Indian reservation is a few miles south of this locality, but they
were placed here by the Government as late as from 1860 to 1865. Previous to that
time I think this ground was occupied by the Omahas. I have been unable to gain
any information as to the Indians who carved these figures or as to their meaning.</p></div>

<p>Frank La Flèche, of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in February, 1886,
communicated the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ingna<sup>n</sup>χe gikáχa-ina is the Omaha name of a rock ledge on the banks of the Missouri

men who passed to the happy hunting grounds, of life size, the sandstone being so
soft that the engravings would be made with a piece of wood. They are represented
with the special cause (arrow, gun, etc.), which sped them to hades. The souls
themselves are said to make these pictographs before repairing “to the spirits.”</p></div>

<h4>NEVADA.</h4>

<p>Petroglyphs have been found by members of the U. S. Geological
Survey at the lower extremity of Pyramid lake, Nevada, though no accurate
reproductions are available. These characters are mentioned as
incised upon the surface of basalt rocks.</p>

<p>Petroglyphs also occur in considerable numbers on the western slope
of Lone Butte, in the Carson desert. All of these appear to have been
produced on the faces of bowlders and rocks by pecking and scratching
with some hard mineral material like quartz.</p>

<p>A communication from Mr. R. L. Fulton, of Reno, Nevada, tells that
the drawing now reproduced as Fig. 54 is a pencil sketch of curious
petroglyphs on a rock on the Carson river, about 8 miles below old<span class="pagenum"><a name="page093" id="page093">[93]</a></span>
Fort Churchill. It is the largest and most important one of a group
of similar characters. It is basaltic, about 4 feet high and equally
broad.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs on Carson river, Nevada.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Fulton gives the following description:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The rock spoken of has an oblong hole about 2 inches by 4 and 16 inches deep at
the left end, which has been chipped out before the lines were drawn, if it was not
some form of the ancient mill which is so common, as it seems to be the starting
point for the whole scheme of the artist. The rock lies with a broad, smooth top
face at an angle towards the south, and its top and southeast side are covered with
lines and marks that convey to the present generation no intelligence whatever, so
far as I can learn.</p>

<p>A line half an inch wide starts at the hole on the left and sweeping downward
forms a sort of border for the work until it reaches midway of the rock, when it suddenly
turns up and mingles with the hieroglyphics above. Two or three similar lines cross
at the top of the stone, and one runs across and turns along the north side, losing
itself in a coating of moss that seems as hard and dry and old as the stone itself.
From the line at the bottom a few scallopy looking marks hang that may be a part
of the picture, or it may be a fringe or ornament. The figures are not pictures of
any animal, bird, or reptile, but seem to be made up of all known forms and are
connected by wavy, snake-like lines. Something which might be taken for a dog
with a round and characterless head at each end of the body, looking towards you,
occupies a place near the lower line. The features are all plain enough. A deer’s
head is joined to a patchwork that has something that might be taken for 4 legs
beneath it. Bird’s claws show up in two or three places, but no bird is near them.
Snaky figures run promiscuously through the whole thing. A circle at the right
end has spokes joining at the center which run out and lose themselves in the maze
outside.</p>

<p>The best known and largest collection of marks that I know of covers a large
smooth ledge at Hopkins Soda Springs, 12 miles south of the summit on the Central
Pacific railroad. The rock is much the same in character as those I have described,
but the groundwork in this case is a solid ledge 10 feet one way and perhaps 40 the
other, all closely covered with rude characters, many of which seem to point to
human figures, animals, reptiles, etc. The ledge lies at an angle of 45°, and
must have been a tempting place for a lazy artist who chanced that way.</p>

<p>Many other places on the Truckee river have such rocks all very much alike, and
yet each bearing its own distinct features in the marking. Near a rock half a mile
east of Verdi, a station on the Central Pacific railroad, 10 miles east of Reno, lie
two others, the larger of which has lines originating in a hole at the upper right-hand
corner, all running in tangents and angles, making a double-ended kind of an
arrangement of many-headed arrows, pointing three ways. A snail-like scroll lies
between the two arms, but does not touch them. Below are blotches, as if the artist
had tried his tools.</p>

<p>This region has been roamed over by the Washoe Indians from a remote period,
but none of them know anything of these works. One who has gray hair and more
wrinkles than hairs, who is bent with age and who is said to be a hundred years
old, was led to the spot. He said he saw them a heap long time ago, when he was
only a few summers old, and they looked then just as they do now.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovejoy, a well-known newspaper man, took up, in 1854, the ranche where
the rocks lie, and said just before his death that they were in exactly the same condition
when he first saw them as they are to-day. Others say the same, and they
are certainly of a date prior to the settlement of this coast by Americans and probably
by the Spanish.</p>

<p>They are very peculiar in many respects, and the rock is wonderfully adapted to
the uses to which it has been put. Wherever the surface has been broken the color<span class="pagenum"><a name="page094" id="page094">[94]</a></span>
has changed to gray, and no amount of wear or weather seems to turn it back. The
indentation is so shallow as to be imperceptible to sight or touch, and yet the marks
are as plain as they could be made, and can be seen as far as the rock can be distinguished
from its fellows.</p>

<p>It is hardly likely that the work was done without some motive besides the simple
love of doing it, and it was well and carefully done, too, showing much patience and
doubtless consumed a good deal of time, as the tools were poor.</p>

<p>A large ledge is marked near Meadow lake in Nevada county, and in the state of
Nevada the petroglyphs cover a route extending from the southeast to the northwest
corner of the state, crossing the line into California in Modoc county, and leaving
a string of samples clear across the Madeline plains.</p>

<p>Eight miles below Belmont, in Nye county, Nevada, an immense rock which at
some time has fallen into the canyon from the porphyry ledge above it has a patch
of marks nearly 20 feet square. It is so high that a man on horseback can not reach
the top.</p>

<p>A number at Reveillé, in the same county, are also marked. On the road to Tybo
every large rock is marked, one of the figures being a semicircle with a short vertical
spoke within the curve. At Reno a heavy black rock a couple of feet across is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page095" id="page095">[95]</a></span>
beautifully engraved to represent a bull’s eye of 4 rings, an arrow with a very large
feather, and one which may mean a man. In a steep canyon 15 miles northeast of
Reno, in Spanish Spring mountains, several cliffs are well marked, and an exposed
ledge, where the Carson river has cut off the point of a hill below Big Bend, is
covered with rings and snakes by the hundred. Several triangles, a well-formed
square and compass, a woman with outstretched arms holding an olive branch, etc.,
are there.</p>

<p>Humboldt county has its share, the best being on a bluff below the old Sheba
mine. Ten miles south of Pioche are about 50 figures cut into the rock, many of
them designed to represent mountain sheep. Eighty miles farther south, near Kane’s
Spring, the most numerous and perfect specimens of this prehistoric art are found.
Men on horseback engaged in the pursuit of animals are among the most numerous,
best preserved, and carefully executed.</p>

<p>The region I have gone over is of immense size, and must impress everyone with
the importance of a set of symbols which extends in broken lines from Arizona far
into Oregon.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 55 exhibits engravings at Reveillé, Nevada. Great numbers of
incised characters of various kinds are also reported from the walls of
rocks flanking Walker river, near Walker lake, Nevada. Waving
lines, rings, and what appear to be vegetable forms are of frequent
occurrence. The human form and footprints are also depicted.</p>

<p>Fig. 56 is a copy of a drawing made by Lieut. A. G. Tassin, Twelfth
U. S. Infantry, in 1877, of an ancient rock-carving at the base and in
the recesses of Dead mountain and the abode of dead bad Indians according
to the Mohave mythology. This drawing and its description is
from a manuscript report on the Mohave Indians, in the library of the
Bureau of Ethnology, prepared by Lieut. Tassin.</p>

<p>He explains some of the characters as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Evidently the two different species of mesquite bean.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Would seem to refer to the bite of the cidatus, and to the use of a certain herb
for its cure.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Presumably the olla or water cooler of the Mohaves.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page096" id="page096">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole of this series of petroglyphs is regarded as being Shinumo
or Moki. They show a general resemblance to drawings in Arizona,
known to have been made by the Moki Indians. The locality is within
the territory of the Shoshonean linguistic division, and the drawings
are in all probability the work of one or more of the numerous tribes
comprised within that division.</p>


<h4>NEW MEXICO.</h4>

<p>On the north wall of Canyon de Chelly, one-fourth of a mile east of
its mouth, are several groups of petroglyphs, consisting chiefly of various
grotesque forms of the human figure, and also numbers of animals,
circles, etc. A few of them are painted black, the greater portion consisting
of rather shallow lines, which are in some places considerably
weathered. Further up the canyon, in the vicinity of the cliff dwellings,
are numerous small groups of pictographic characters, consisting
of men and animals, waving or zigzag lines, and other odd figures.</p>

<p>Lieut. James H. Simpson (<i>a</i>), in his Journal of a Military Reconnoissance,
etc., presents a number of plates bearing copies of inscriptions
on rocks in the northwestern part of New Mexico, among which are
those on the so-called “Inscription rock” at El Moro, here reproduced
as Fig. 57. The petroglyphs are selected from the south face of the
rock. Lieut. Simpson states that most of the characters are no higher
than a man’s head, and that some of them are undoubtedly of Indian
origin.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the many colored etchings and paintings on rock discovered
by the Pacific railroad expedition in 1853-’54, Lieut. Whipple (<i>c</i>) notes
those at Rocky dell creek, New Mexico, which were found between the
edge of the Llano Estacado and the Canadian river. The stream flows
through a gorge, upon one side of which a shelving sandstone rock
forms a sort of cave. The roof is covered with paintings, some evidently
ancient, and beneath are innumerable carvings of footprints,
animals, and symmetrical lines. He also remarks (<i>d</i>) that figures cut
upon a rock at Arch spring, near Zuñi, present some faint similarity
to those at Rocky dell creek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page097" id="page097">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Near Ojo Pescado, in the vicinity of the ruins, are petroglyphs, also
reported by Lieut. Whipple (<i>d</i>), which are very much weather-worn
and have “no trace of a modern hand about them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin A. Hill, of Indianapolis, in a letter, notes petroglyphs on
the Denver and Rio Grande railroad, between Antonite and Espanola.
Below Tres Piedras and near Espanola are rude sculptures, lining the
valley on both sides of the road for a long distance, at least several
miles. The canyon has a slope of about 45° and contains many
bowlders, and on every available face pictographs are cut. Figures of
arrows, hatchets, circles, triangles, bows, spears, turtles, etc., are outlined
as if with some cutting-tool. The country had two years before
been occupied by Apaches, but far greater age is attributed to the
petroglyphs.</p>

<p>Other petroglyphs actually within the geographical area of New
Mexico are so near the border that they are treated of in connection
with those of Colorado.</p>

<p>Prof. E. D. Cope (<i>a</i>) gives a copy of figures which he found on the
side of a ravine near Abiquiu, on the river Chama. They are cut in
Jurassic sandstone of medium hardness, and are quite worn and overgrown
with the small lichen which is abundant on the face of the rock.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilbert Thompson, of the U. S. Geological Survey, reports his
observation of petroglyphs at San Antonio springs, 30 miles east of
Fort Wingate, New Mexico. The human figure, in various forms, occurs,
as well as numerous other characters, strikingly similar to those frequent
in the country farther west occupied by the Moki Indians. The
peculiarity of these figures is that the outlines are incised and that
the depressions thus formed are filled with red, blue or white pigments.
The interior of the figures is simply painted with one or more
of the same colors.</p>

<p>Figs. 58 and 59 are reproductions of drawings of petroglyphs from
Ojo de Benado, south of Zuñi, New Mexico. The manuscripts which
once accompanied them, and which were forwarded to the Bureau of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page098" id="page098">[98]</a></span>
Ethnology in the usual official manner, have become separated from the
sketches, and on those there are no indications of the collectors’ names.</p>

</div>

<p>The characters are very like others from several localities in the territory
and in the adjacent region. The type is that of the Pueblos generally.</p>

<p>Mr. Bandelier, in conversation, reported having seen and sketched a
petroglyph at Nambe, in a canyon about 2 miles east of the pueblo,
also another at Cueva Pintada, about 17 miles by the trail northwest
of Cochiti.</p>

<h4>NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>The following is extracted from Schoolcraft (<i>c</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a pictographic Indian inscription [now obliterated] in the valley of the
Hudson, above the Highlands, which from its antiquity and character appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page099" id="page099">[99]</a></span>
denote the era of the introduction of firearms and gunpowder among the aboriginal
tribes of that valley. This era, from the well-known historical events of the contemporaneous
settlement of New Netherlands and New France, may be with general
accuracy placed between the years 1609, the date of Hudson’s ascent of that stream
above the Highlands, and the opening of the Indian trade with the Iroquois at the
present site of Albany, by the erection of Fort Orange, in 1614. * * *</p>

<p>In a map published at Amsterdam, in Holland, in 1659, the country, for some distance
both above and below Esopus creek, is delineated as inhabited by the Waranawankongs,
who were a totemic division or enlarged family clan of the Mohikinder.
They spoke a well-characterized dialect of the Mohigan, and have left numerous
geographical names on the streams and physical peculiarities of that part of the
river coast quite to and above Coxsackie. The language is Algonquin.</p>

<p>Esopus itself appears to be a word derived from Seepu, the Minsi-Algonquin name
for a river.</p>

<p>* * * The inscription may be supposed, if the era is properly conjectured, to
have been made with metallic tools. The lines are deeply and plainly impressed.
It is in double lines. The plumes from the head denote a chief or man skilled in the
Indian medico-magical art. The gun is held at rest in the right hand; the left appears
to support a wand. [The position of the arm may be merely a gesture.]</p></div>

<p>The reproduction here as Fig. 60 is from a rock on the western bank of
the Hudson, at Esopus landing. It is presented mainly on account of
the frequent allusions to it in literature.</p>

<h4>NORTH CAROLINA.</h4>

<p>Mr. James Mooney, of the Bureau of Ethnology, reports petroglyphs
upon a gray gneissoid rock, a short distance east of Caney river, on the
north side of the road from Asheville to Burnsville, North Carolina. The
face of the surface is at an angle of 30° toward the south, and the
sculptured area covers about 10 feet square. The characters consist
chiefly of cup-shaped depressions, some about 2 inches deep, some being
also connected. There are a few markings which appear to have been
intended to represent footprints. The characters resemble, to some
extent, those at Trap Rock gap, Georgia, and at the Juttaculla rock,
North Carolina, on a branch of the Tuckasegee river, above Webster.</p>

<p>The above-described sculptured rock is on the property of Ellis Gardner,
and is known as Gardner’s, or the “Garden rock.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mooney also reports that at Webster, North Carolina, there is
one large rock bearing numerous petroglyphs, rings, cup-shaped depressions,
fish-bone patterns, etc. He further states, upon the authority
of Dr. J. M. Spainhour, of Lenoir, that upon a light gray rock measuring
4 feet by 30 are numerous cup-shaped petroglyphs, he having
counted 215. The rock is on the Yadkin river, 4 miles below Wilkesboro,
and is at times partly under water.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoffman, who in 1886 visited western North Carolina, gives the
following account of colored pictographs found there by him.</p>

<p>“The locality known as ‘Paint rock’ is situated on the east or right
bank of the French Broad river, about 100 yards above the Tennessee
and North Carolina state line. The limestone cliff, which terminates
abruptly near the river, measures about 100 feet in height and covers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100">[100]</a></span>
an area from side to side of exposure of at least 100 yards. The accompanying
view (Fig. 61), taken from across the river, presents the wall
of limestone rock and the position of the petroglyph, which is delineated
in proper proportion nearly in the center of the illustration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp157_pg100ah.jpg">
<img src="images/dp157_pg100a.jpg" class="hires" width="500" height="262" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>&mdash;Paint rock, North Carolina.</div>
</div>

<p>“The property belongs to Mr. J. W. Chockley, who has been living in
the vicinity for about fifteen years. He states that during this time
the pictograph has undergone some change on account of gradual disintegration
or fracture of the rock. The first knowledge of the pictograph,
according to local tradition, dates back about sixty years, and
no information as to its import could be learned, either from the white
residents, who are few in number, or the straggling Cherokee Indians
who visit the railway station at odd intervals.”</p>

<p>The pictograph is peculiar in design, no animal forms being apparent
but an indefinite number of short, straight lines at right angles to one
another, as shown in Fig. 62. One-thirty-sixth actual size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 537px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs on Paint rock, North Carolina.</div>
</div>

<p>The characters are in dark red, probably a ferrous oxide, quantities
of which are found in the neighborhood. The color appears to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101">[101]</a></span>
penetrated the softer portions of the limestone, though upon the harder
surfaces it has been removed by exposure to the elements. The lowermost
figure appears to resemble a rude outline of a human form, with
one arm lowered and reaching forward, though this is only a suggestion.</p>

<p>Upon the face of the rock, a few yards to the right of the above, are
indistinct outlines of circles, several of which indicate central spots,
and one, at least, has a line extending from the center downward for
about 8 inches.</p>


<h4>OHIO.</h4>

<p>A large number of petroglyphs are reported from this state. It is
sufficient to present the following examples extracted, with reproduced
illustrations and abbreviated descriptions, from the Report of the Committee
of the State Archæological Society, published in the Report of
the Ohio State Board of Centennial Managers.</p>

<p>Fig. 63 is a copy of the petroglyph on the Newark Track rock.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp158_pg101h.png">
<img src="images/dp158_pg101.png" class="hires" width="500" height="231" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>&mdash;Newark Track rock, Ohio.</div>
</div>

<p>It is described in the volume cited, pages 94, 95, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inscriptions near Newark, in Licking county, Ohio, originally covered a vertical
face of conglomerate rock, 50 or 60 feet in length, by 6 and 8 feet in height.
This rock is soft and, therefore, the figures are easily erased * * *. About the
year 1800 it became a place where white men sought to immortalize themselves by
cutting their names across the old inscription * * *.</p>

<p>On the rock faces and detached sandstone blocks of the banks of the Ohio river
there are numerous groups of intaglios, but in them the style is quite different from
those to which I have referred, and which are located in the interior. Those on the
Ohio river resemble the symbolical records of the North American Indians, such as
the Kelley Island stone, described in Schoolcraft by Capt. Eastman, the Dighton
rock, the Big Indian rock of the Susquehanna, and the “God rock” of the Allegheny
river. In those the supposed bird track is generally wanting. The large sculptured
rock near Wellsville, which is only visible at low water of the Ohio, has among the
figures one that is prominent on the Barnesville stones. This is the fore foot of the
bear, with the outside toe distorted and set outward at right angles.</p>

<p>Other sculptured rocks of a similar character have been found in Fairfield, Belmont,
Cuyahoga, and Lorain counties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>That the ancient bird-track character belonged to the mound-builders is evident
from the fact that it is found among their works, constructed of soil on a large scale.</p>

<p>One of these bird-track mounds occurs in the center of the large circular inclosure
near Newark, Ohio, now standing in the Licking county fair grounds. Among the
characters will be noticed the human hand. In one instance the hand is open, the
palm facing the observer, and in the other the hand is closed, except the index
finger which points downward to the base of the cliff. Of the bird-track characters
there are many varieties. There is also a character resembling a cross and another
bearing some resemblance to an arrow.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 64 is an illustration of the Independence stone, which is described
in the same volume, pp. 98, 99, as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span>&mdash;Independence stone, Ohio.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Great care has been taken to obtain a correct sketch of what remains of this inscription.
A very rude drawing of it was published in Schoolcraft’s great work
upon the Indian tribes, in 1854.</p>

<p>The rock here described only contains a portion of the inscription. The balance
was destroyed in quarrying. The markings on the portion of the rock preserved
consist of the human foot, clothed with something like a moccasin or stocking; of
the naked foot; of the open hand; of round markings one in front of the great toe,
of each representation of the clothed foot; the figure of a serpent, and a peculiar
character which might be taken for a rude representation of a crab or crawfish, but
which bears a closer resemblance to an old-fashioned spearhead used in capturing
fish.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 65 is a copy of the drawings on the Track rock, near Barnesville,
Belmont county, Ohio, the description of which is in the same
volume, pp. 89-93.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 251px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span>&mdash;Barnesville Track rock, Ohio.</div>
</div>

<p>The rude cuts of the human faces, part of the human feet, the rings,
stars, serpents, and some others, are evidently works of art, as in the
best of them the marks of the engraving instrument are to be seen. In
all cases, whether single or in groups, the relative dimensions of the
figures are preserved. The surface of this block is 8 by 11 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>At the south end of the petroglyphs occurs a figure of several concentric
rings, a design by no means confined to Ohio. The third figure
right of this resembles others in the same group, and evidently indicates
the footprints of the buffalo. Human footprints are generally indicated
by the pronounced toe marks, either detached as slight depressions or
attached to the foot, and are thus recognized as different from bear
tracks, which frequently have but slight indications of toes or perhaps
claw marks, and in which also the foot is shorter or rounder. The
arrow-shaped figures are no doubt intended for turkey tracks, characters
common to many petroglyphs of the middle and eastern Algonquian
area.</p>

<p>Fig. 66 gives several of the above characters enlarged from the preceding
figure.</p>

the characters before noted&mdash;human footprints, bear and turkey tracks,

sculptures on a flat sand rock of the coal series, scarred by floating ice and flood
wood. They are only visible in low water, as they are only 2 or 3 feet above the extreme
low stage of the river. * * * They are made in double outline and not by
a single deep channel. The outlines are a series of dots made with a round-pointed
instrument, seldom more than half an inch deep.</p>

<p>The upper design is a rattlesnake with a fancy head and tail. Its length is 4&frac12; feet,
a very clumsy affair, but intended for the common yellow rattlesnake of the West.
The head of the snake, which occupies a space 6 inches square,
is represented in the second character, which is reduced from
a tracing size of nature. It brings to mind the horned snake
of the Egyptians, which was an object of worship by them.</p>

<p>The character at the left hand of the lower line may be an
uncouth representation of a demon or evil spirit. The right-hand
character is probably an otter carrying a vine or string
in his month.</p></div>

<p>It is more probable that the lines from the mouth of the animal indicate
magic or supernatural power, of which many examples appear in
this paper, as also of the device in the region of the animal’s heart,
from which a line extends to the mouth. These characteristics connect
the glyph with the Ojibwa drawings on bark.</p>


<h4>OREGON.</h4>

<p>Many bowlders and rock escarpments at and near the Dalles of the
Columbia river, Oregon, are covered with incised or pecked glyphs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105">[105]</a></span>
Some of them are representations of human figures, but characters of
other forms predominate.</p>

<p>Mr. Albert S. Gatschet, of the Bureau of Ethnology, reports the discovery
by him, in 1878, of rock etchings 4 miles from Gaston, Oregon,
and 2&frac12; miles from the ancient settlement of the Tuálati (or Atfálati) Indians.
These etchings are about 100 feet above the valley bottom on
six rocks of soft sandstone, projecting from the grassy hillside of Patten’s
valley, opposite Darling Smith’s farm, and are surrounded with
timber on two sides.</p>

<p>This sandstone ledge extends for one-eighth of a mile horizontally
along the hillside, upon the projecting portions of which the inscriptions
are found. These rocks differ greatly in size, and slant forward
so that the inscribed portions are exposed to the frequent rains of that
region. The first rock, or that one nearest the mouth of the canyon,
consists of horizontal zigzag lines and a detached straight line, also
horizontal. On another side of the same rock is a series of oblique
parallel lines. Some of the most striking characters found upon other
exposed portions of the rock appear to be human figures, i. e., circles
to which radiating lines are attached, and bear indications of eyes
and mouth, long vertical lines running downward as if to represent the
body, and terminating in a furcation, as if intended for legs, toes, etc.
To the right of one figure is an arm and three-fingered hand (similar to
some of the Moki characters), bent downward from the elbow, the
humerus extending at a right angle from the body. Horizontal rows
of short vertical lines are placed below and between some of the figures,
probably numerical marks of some kind.</p>

<p>Other characters occur of various forms, the most striking being an
arrow pointing upward, with two horizontal lines drawn across the
shaft, and with vertical lines having short oblique lines attached
thereto.</p>

<p>Mr. Gatschet remarks that the Tuálati tell a trivial story to explain
the origin of these pictures, the substance of which is as follows: The
Tillamuk warriors living on the Pacific coast were often at variance
with the several Kalapuya tribes. One day, passing through Patten’s
valley to invade the country of the Tuálati, they inquired of a woman
how far they were from their camp. The woman, desirous not to betray
her own countrymen, said they were yet at a distance of one (or two?)
days’ travel. This made them reflect over the intended invasion, and,
holding a council, they decided to withdraw. In commemoration of
this the inscription, with its numeration marks, was incised by the
Tuálati.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles Rau received from Dr. James S. Denison, physician at
the Klamath agency, Lake county, Oregon, a communication relative
to the practice of painting figures on rocks in the territory of the Klamath
Indians in Oregon. There are in that neighborhood many rocks
bearing painted figures; but Dr. Rau’s (<i>b</i>) description refers specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106">[106]</a></span>
to a single rock, called Ktá-i Tupákshi (standing rock), situated about
50 yards north of Sprague river and 150 yards from the junction of
Sprague and Williamson rivers. It is about 10 feet high, 14 feet long,
and 12 or 14 feet deep. Fig. 69, drawn one-twelfth of the natural size,
illustrates the character of the paintings seen on the smooth southern
surface of this rock. The most frequent designs are single or concentric
circles, like Fig. 69, <i>a</i>, which consists of a dark red circle surrounded
by a white one, the center being formed by a round red spot.
Fig. 69, <i>b</i>, painted in dark red and white colors, exhibits a somewhat
Mahadeo-like shape; the straight appendage of the circle is provided
on each side with short projecting lines, alternately red and white, and
almost producing the effect of the so-called herring-bone ornament.</p>

<p>Fig. 69, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, executed in dark red, are other designs seen on the
standing rock above mentioned. The colors, which, as the informant
thinks, are rubbed in with grease, appear quite distinct on the dark
surface of the rock.</p>


<h4>PENNSYLVANIA.</h4>

<p>Along the river courses in northern and western Pennsylvania many
rocks are found bearing traces of carvings, though, on account of the
character of the geological formations, some of them are nearly obliterated.</p>

<p>In 1875 Mr. P. W. Shafer published in a historical map of Pennsylvania
several groups of pictographs. These had before appeared in a rude
and crowded form in the Transactions of the Anthropological Institute
of New York, 1871-’72, page 66, where the localities are mentioned as
“Big” and “Little” Indian rocks, respectively. One of these rocks is
in the Susquehanna river, below the dam at Safe harbor, and the drawing
clearly shows its Algonquian origin. The characters are nearly all
either animals or various forms of the human body. Birds, bird tracks,
and serpents also occur. A part of this pictograph is presented below,
Fig. <a href="#page678">1089</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. W. J. Hoffman visited this place during the autumn of 1889 and
made sketches of the petroglyphs. The Algonquian type of delineation
of objects is manifest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The rock known as “Big Indian rock” is in the Susquehanna river,
three-fourths of a mile below the mouth of Conestoga creek and about
400 yards from the eastern bank of the Susquehanna. It is one of
many, but larger than any other in the immediate vicinity, measuring
about 60 feet in length, 30 feet in width, and an average height of
about 20 feet. The upper surface is uneven, though smoothly worn,
and upon this are pecked the characters, shown in Fig. 70.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp164_pg107h.png">
<img src="images/dp164_pg107.png" class="hires" width="500" height="431" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>&mdash;Big Indian rock, Pennsylvania.</div>
</div>

<p>The characters, through exposure to the elements, are becoming
rather indistinct, though a few of them are pecked so deep that they
still present a depression of from one-fourth to one-half an inch in
depth. The most conspicuous objects consist of human figures, thunder
birds, and animals resembling the panther.</p>

<p>“Little Indian rock” is also situated in the Susquehanna river, one-fourth
of a mile from the eastern bank and a like distance below the
mouth of Conestoga creek. This rock, also of hard micaceous schist,
is not so large as the one above mentioned, but bears more interesting
characters, the most conspicuous being representations of the thunder
bird, serpents, deer and bird tracks, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp165_pg108ah.png">
<img src="images/dp165_pg108a.png" class="hires" width="500" height="231" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span>&mdash;Little Indian rock, Pennsylvania.</div>
</div>

<p>Prof. Persifor Frazer, jr., (<i>b</i>) remarks upon the gradual obliteration
of these pictographs, and adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In addition to these causes of obliteration it is a pity to have to record another,
which is the vandalism of some visitors to the locality who have thought it an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108">[108]</a></span>
practical joke to cut spurious figures alongside of and sometimes over those
made by the Indians. It is not unlikely, too, that the “fish pots” here, as in the
case of the Bald Friar’s inscriptions, a few miles below the Maryland line, may have
been constructed in great part out of fragments of rock containing these hieroglyphics,
so that the parts of the connected story which they relate are separated and the
record thus destroyed.</p>

<p>Others have cut their initials or full names in these rocks, thus for an obscure
record whose unriddling would award the antiquarian, substituting one, the correct
deciphering of which leads to obscurity itself.</p></div>

<p>At McCalls ferry, on the Susquehanna river, in Lancaster county,
and on the right shore near the water’s edge, is a gray gneissoid flat
rock, bearing petroglyphs that have been pecked upon the surface.
It is irregular in shape, measuring about 3&frac12; by 4 feet in superficial
area, upon which is a circle covering nearly the entire surface, in the
middle of which is a smaller circle with a central point. On one side
of the inner space, between the outer and inner circles, are a number of
characters resembling human figures and others of unintelligible form.
The petroglyph is represented in Fig. 72.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph at McCalls ferry, Pennsylvania.</div>
</div>

<p>The resemblance between these drawings and those on Dighton rock
is to be noted, as well as that between both of them and some in Ohio.
All those localities are within the area formerly occupied by tribes of
the Algonquian stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Near Washington, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, on “Mill stream,”
one-fourth of a mile above its junction with the Susquehanna river, is a
large bowlder of gray sandstone (Fig. 73), the exposed portion of which
bears several deeply incised lines which appear to have served as topographic
indicators, as several others of like kind occur farther downstream.
The longest incision is about 28 inches in length, the next one
parallel to it, about 14 inches, while the third character is V-shaped,
one arm of which is about 10 inches in length and the other 12. The
apex of this character points in a southeast direction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp166_pg109h.jpg">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph near Washington, Pennsylvania.</div>
</div>

<p>One-eighth of a mile farther down is another bowlder, also near the
water, which bears shorter lines than the preceding, but in general
pointing almost southeast and northwest.</p>

<p>The workmanship is similar to that at Conowingo, Maryland, at the
site of the Bald Friar rocks. The marks appear to have been chipped
to a considerable depth and then rubbed with sand and some hard substance
so as to present a smooth and even surface, removing all or
nearly all of the pecked surface.</p>

<p>Mr. P. W. Shafer, on the same historical map of Pennsylvania before
mentioned, presents also a group of pictures copied from the originals
on the Alleghany river, in Venango county, 5 miles south of Franklin,
on what is known as the Indian God rock. There are but six characters
furnished in his copy, three of which are variations of the human
form, while the others are undetermined.</p>

<p>This rock was visited in 1886 by Dr. Hoffman, who made a number of
drawings of objects represented, of which only those in Fig. 74 are
here reproduced. The face of the bowlder bearing the original petroglyphs
has been much disfigured by visitors who, in endeavoring to display
their skill by pecking upon the surface names, dates, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110">[110]</a></span>
designs, have so injured it that it is difficult to trace the original
characters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp167_pg110h.png">
<img src="images/dp167_pg110.png" class="hires" width="500" height="303" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs on “Indian God rock.”</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 74, <i>a</i>, represents, apparently, a panther. Above and beneath it
are markings resembling wolf tracks, while farther down is a turkey
track, and in the left-hand lower corner is a human form, such as is
usually found upon rocks in the areas represented by Shoshonian tribes.</p>

<p>The design at <i>b</i> is much mutilated and eroded, and may originally
have been a character like <i>a</i>, the first of this series.</p>

<p>The characters at <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> are evidently human faces, the former representing
that of the sun, the latter being very much like a mask. That
at <i>e</i> is found upon other Algonquian rocks, notably those called “Bald
Friar,” Maryland, in the Susquehanna river, immediately below the
state line of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The bowlder upon which these petroglyphs are engraved lies at the
water’s edge, and during each freshet the lower half of the surface and
sometimes even more is under water. At these times floating logs,
impelled according to the curve in the river immediately above, are
directed toward this rock, which may explain the worn surface and
the eroded condition of the sculpture.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Sutton Wall, of Monongahela city, describes in correspondence
a rock bearing pictographs opposite the town of Millsboro, in Fayette
county, Pennsylvania. This rock is about 390 feet above the level
of the Monongahela river, and belongs to the Waynesburg stratum of
sandstone. It is detached and rests somewhat below its true horizon.
It is about 6 feet in thickness, and has vertical sides; only two figures
are carved on the sides, the principal inscriptions being on the top, and
all are now considerably worn. Mr. Wall mentions the outlines of
animals and some other figures formed by grooves or channels cut from
an inch to a mere trace in depth. No indications of tool marks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111">[111]</a></span>
discovered. The footprints are carved depressions. The character
marked z, near the lower left-hand corner, is a circular cavity 7 inches
deep. A copy of the inscription made in 1882 by Mr. Wall and Mr.
William Arison is reproduced as Fig. 75.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph at Millsboro, Pennsylvania.</div>
</div>

<p>Again the resemblance between these drawings, those on Dighton
rock, and some of those in Ohio, introduced above, is to be noted, and
the fact that all these localities are within the area formerly occupied
by tribes of the Algonquian stock.</p>

<p>Mr. Wall also contributes a group of glyphs on what is known as
the “Geneva Picture rock,” in the Monongahela valley, near Geneva.
These are footprints and other characters similar to those from Hamilton
farm, West Virginia, which are shown in Fig. <a href="#page677">1088</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. L. W. Brown, of Redstone, Fayette county, Pennsylvania, mentions
a rock near Layton, in that county, which measures about 15
by 25 feet in area, upon the surface of which occur a number of petroglyphs
consisting of the human figure, animals, and footprints, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112">[112]</a></span>
of which are difficult to trace. From a rough sketch reproduced as
Fig. 76, made by Mr. Brown, these appear to be Algonquian in type.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs near Layton, Pennsylvania.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Brown also submitted for examination two pieces of chocolate-colored,
smooth, fine grained slate, of hard texture, bearing upon the
several sides outlines of incised figures. The specimens were found in
Indian graves in Fayette county, Pennsylvania. The outline of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113">[113]</a></span>
incisions, although they are not strictly petroglyphs, are reproduced in
Figs. 77 and 78.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>&mdash;Glyphs in Fayette county, Pennsylvania.</div>
</div>

<p>The designs are made in delicate lines, as if scratched with a sharply
pointed piece of quartz, or possibly metal. The character <i>d</i> on Fig.
78 is the representation of a fish, which has been accentuated by additional
cutting since found. The characters resemble the Algonquian
type, many of them being frequently found among those tribes living
along the Great Lakes.</p>

<h4>RHODE ISLAND.</h4>

<p>In C. C. Rafn’s Antiq. Amer. (<i>c</i>), is the following account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Portsmouth rocks.</i>&mdash;The rocks, for there are several of them, are situated on the
western side of the island of Rhode Island, in the town of Portsmouth, on the shore,
about 7 miles from Newport, taking the western road, and 4 miles from Bristol
ferry. * * * They are partially, if not entirely, covered by water at high tide;
and such was the state of the tide and the lateness of the hour when the location
was ascertained, that I was unable to make a thorough examination of them. I saw
sufficient, however, to satisfy me that they were formerly well covered with characters,
although a large portion of them have become obliterated by the action of
air and moisture, and probably still more by the attrition of masses of stone against
them in violent storms and gales, and by the ruthless ravages of that most destructive
power of all, the hand of man.</p>

<p><i>Tiverton rocks</i> [op. cit. <i>d</i>].&mdash;Their situation may be thus known: by tracing along
the east side of the map of Rhode Island until you strike Tiverton, and then following
along to the southwest extremity of that town, the Indian name Puncoteast, also
the English names Almy and High Hill, will be seen. The inscriptions are on masses
of Graywacke. * * * We can only state they were occupied with some kind of
characters.</p></div>

<p>These two inscriptions are pictured, op. cit., Table <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114">[114]</a></span></p>


<h4>SOUTH DAKOTA.</h4>

<p>Mr. T. H. Lewis (<i>c</i>), gives a description of Fig. 79 as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This bowlder is on a high terrace on the west side of the Minnesota river, 1&frac12; miles
south of Browns valley, and is in Roberts county, South Dakota. It is oblong in
form, being 3&frac12; feet in length, 2 feet in width, and is firmly imbedded in the ground.</p>

<p>Of the characters <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are undoubtedly tortoises; <i>c</i> is probably intended to represent
a bird track; <i>d</i> represents a man, and is similar to the one at Browns valley,
Minnesota, [Fig. <a href="#page090">51</a>, supra;] <i>e</i> is a nondescript of unusual form; <i>f</i> is apparently intended
to represent a headless bird, in that respect greatly resembling certain earthen
effigies in the regions to the southeast.</p>

<p>The figures are about one-fourth of an inch in depth and very smooth, excepting
along their edges, which roughness is caused by a slight unevenness of the surface
of the bowlder.</p></div>

<p>The same authority, op. cit., describes Fig. 79, <i>g</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This bowlder, 4 miles northwest of Browns valley, Minnesota, is in Roberts county,
South Dakota.</p>

<p>The figures here represented are roughly pecked into the stone, and were never
finished; for the grooves that form the pictograph on other bowlders in this region
have been rubbed until they are perfectly smooth. The face of the bowlder upon
which these occur is about 2 feet long and 1&frac12; feet in width.</p></div>


<h4>TENNESSEE.</h4>

<p>Mr. John Haywood (<i>a</i>) gives the following account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About 2 miles below the road which crosses the Harpeth river from Nashville to
Charlotte is a large mound 30 or 40 feet high. About 6 miles from it is a large rock,
on the side of the river, with a perpendicular face of 70 or 80 feet altitude. On it,
below the top some distance and on the side, are painted the sun and moon in yellow
colors, which have not faded since the white people first knew it. The figure of
the sun is 6 feet in diameter; that of the moon is of the old moon. The sun and
moon are also painted on a high rock on the side of the Cumberland river, in a spot
which several ladders placed upon each other could not reach, and which is also inaccessible
except by ropes let down the summit of the rock to the place where the
painting was performed. * * * The sun is also painted on a high rock on the
side of the Cumberland river, 6 or 7 miles below Clarksville; and it is said to be
painted also at the junction of the Holston and French Broad rivers, above Knoxville,
in East Tennessee; also on Duck river, below the bend called the Devil’s Elbow,
on the west side of the river, on a bluff; and on a perpendicular flat rock facing
the river, 20 feet below the top of the bluff and 60 above the water, out of which the
rock rises, is the painted representation of the sun in red and yellow colors, 6 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115">[115]</a></span>
in circumference, yellow on the upper side and a yellowish red on the lower. The
colors are very fresh and unfaded. The rays, both yellow and red, are represented
as darting from the center. It has been spoken of ever since the river was navigated
and has been there from time immemorial. * * *</p>

<p>The painting on Big Harpeth, before spoken of, is more than 80 feet from the
water and 30 or 40 below the summit. All these paintings are in unfading colors,
and on parts of the rock inaccessible to animals of every description except the fowls
of the air. The painting is neatly executed, and was performed at an immense hazard
of the operator.</p></div>

<p>Mr. W. M. Clarke, in Smithsonian Report for 1877, page 275, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the bluffs of the Big Harpeth many pictures of Indians, deer, buffalo, and bows
and arrows are to be seen. These pictures are rudely drawn, but the coloring is as
perfect now as when first put on.</p></div>

<p>Haywood (<i>b</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At a gap of the mountains and near the head of Brasstown creek, which is toward
the head of the Hiawassee, and among the highlands, is a large horizontal rock on
which are engraved the tracks of deer, bears, horses, wolves, turkeys, and barefooted
human beings of all sizes. Some of the horses’ tracks appear to have slipped forward.
The direction of them is westward. Near them are signs of graves.</p></div>

<p>He also (<i>c</i>) gives the following account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the south bank of the Holston, 5 miles above the mouth of French Broad, is a
bluff of limestone opposite the mounds and a cave in it. The bluff is 100 feet in height.
On it are painted in red colors, like those on the Paint rock, the sun and moon, a man,
birds, fishes, etc. The paintings have in part faded within a few years. Tradition
says these paintings were made by the Cherokees, who were accustomed in their
journeys to rest at this place. Wherever on the rivers of Tennessee are perpendicular
bluffs, on the sides, and especially if caves be near, are often found mounds
near them, inclosed in intrenchments, with the sun and moon painted on the rocks,
and charcoal and ashes in the smaller mounds. These tokens seem to be evincive of
a connection between the mounds, the charcoal and ashes, the paintings and the
caves.</p></div>


<h4>TEXAS.</h4>

<p>Mr. J. R. Bartlett (<i>b</i>) gives the following account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About 30 miles from El Paso del Norte, in Texas, very near the boundary line of
Mexico, there is an overhanging rock, extending for some distance, the whole surface
of which is covered with rude paintings and sculptures, representing men, animals,
birds, snakes, and fantastic figures. The colors used are black, red, white,
and a brownish yellow. The sculptures are mere peckings with a sharp instrument
just below the surface of the rock. The accompanying engravings [reproduced in
Fig. 80] show the character of the figures and the taste of the designers. Hundreds
of similar ones are painted on the rocks at this place. Some of them, evidently of
great age, had been partly defaced to make room for more recent devices.</p>

<p>The overhanging rock, beneath which we encamped, seemed to have been a favorite
place of resort for the Indians, as it is at the present day for all passing travelers.
The recess formed by this rock is about 15 feet in length by 10 in width. Its entire
surface is covered with paintings, one laid on over the other, so that it is difficult
to make out those which belong to the aborigines. I copied a portion of these figures,
about which there can be no doubt as to the origin. They represent Indians
with shields and bows, painted with a brownish earth; horses, with their riders; uncouth
looking animals, and a large rattlesnake. Similar devices cover the rock in
every part, but are much defaced. Near this overhanging rock is the largest and
finest tank or pool of water to be found about here. It is only reached by clambering<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116">[116]</a></span>
on the hands and knees 15 or 20 feet up a steep rock. Over it projects a gigantic
bowlder, which, resting on or wedged between other rocks, leaves a space of about 4
feet above the surface of the water. On the underside of this bowlder are fantastic
designs in red paint, which could only have been made by persons lying on their
backs in this cool and sheltered spot.</p></div>

</div>

<p>Mr. Charles Hallock, of Washington, District of Columbia, gives information
that there is a locality termed the Painted caves, “on the
Rio Grande, near Devil’s river, in Crockett county, Texas, on the line
of the ‘Sunset’ railroad. Here the rock is gray limestone and the petroglyphs
are for the most part sculptured. They are in great variety,
from a manifest antiquity to the most recent date; for these cliff caverns
have been from time immemorial the refuge and resort of all sorts
of wayfarers, marauders, and adventurers, who have painted, cut, and
carved in every geometrical and grotesque form imaginable.”</p>


<h4>UTAH.</h4>

<p>Carvings and paintings on rocks are found in such numbers in the
southern interior of Utah that a locality there has been named Pictograph
rocks.</p>

<p>Mr. G. K. Gilbert, of the U. S. Geological Survey, collected in 1875
a number of copies of inscriptions in Temple creek canyon, southeastern
Utah, and noted their finding as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The drawings were found only on the northeast wall of the canyon, where it cuts
the Vermillion cliff sandstone. The chief parts are etched, apparently by pounding
with a sharp point. The outline of a figure is usually more deeply cut than the
body. Other marks are produced by rubbing or scraping, and still others by laying
on colors. Some, not all, of the colors are accompanied by a rubbed appearance, as
though the material had been a dry chalk.</p>

<p>I could discover no tools at the foot of the wall, only fragments of pottery, flints,
and a metate.</p>

<p>Several fallen blocks of sandstone have rubbed depressions that may have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117">[117]</a></span>
ground out in the sharpening of tools. There have been many dates of inscriptions,
and each new generation has unscrupulously run its lines over the pictures already
made. Upon the best protected surfaces, as well as the most exposed, there are
drawings dimmed beyond restoration and others distinct. The period during which
the work accumulated was longer by far than the time which has passed since the
last. Some fallen blocks cover etchings on the wall, and are themselves etched.</p>

<p>Colors are preserved only where there is almost complete shelter from rain. In
two places the holes worn in the rock by swaying branches impinge on etchings,
but the trees themselves have disappeared. Some etchings are left high and dry by
a diminishing talus (15 to 20 feet), but I saw none partly buried by an increasing
talus (except in the case of the fallen block already mentioned).</p>

<p>The painted circles are exceedingly accurate, and it seems incredible that they
were made without the use of a radius.</p></div>

<p>In the collection contributed by Mr. Gilbert there are at least fifteen
series or groups of figures, most of which consist of the human form
(from the simplest to the most complex style of drawing), animals,
either singly or in long files&mdash;as if driven&mdash;bird tracks, human feet and
hands, etc. There are also circles, parallel lines, and waving or undulating
lines, spots, and other characters.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilbert also reports the discovery, in 1883, of a great number of
pictographs, chiefly in color, though some are only incised, in a canyon
of the Book cliff containing Thompson’s spring, about 4 miles north of
Thompson’s station, on the Denver and Colorado Railroad, Utah. He
has also furnished a collection of drawings of pictographs at Black
rock spring, on Beaver creek, north of Milford, Utah. A number of
fallen blocks of basalt at a low escarpment are filled with etchings upon
the vertical faces. The characters generally are of an “unintelligible”
nature, though the human figure is drawn in complex forms. Footprints
and circles abound.</p>

<p>Mr. I. C. Russell, of the U. S. Geological Survey, furnished rude
drawings of pictographs at Black rock spring, Utah (see Fig. <a href="#page681">1093</a>).
Mr. Gilbert Thompson also discovered pictographs at Fool creek canyon,
Utah (see Fig. <a href="#page681">1094</a>).</p>

<p>Mr. Vernon Bailey, in a letter dated January 18, 1889, reports that
in the vicinity of St. George “all along the sandstone cliffs are strange
figures like hieroglyphics and pictures of animals cut in the rocks, but
now often worn dim.”</p>

<p>Mr. George Pope, of Provo city, Utah county, in a letter, kindly gives
an account of an inscription on a rock in a canyon at the mouth of
Provo river, about 7 miles from the city named. There is no paint seen,
the inscription being cut. A human hand is conspicuous, being cut
(probably pecked) to a depth of at least one-third of an inch, and so
with representations of animals.</p>

<p>Dr. Rau (<i>c</i>) gives the design of a portion of a group carved on a cliff
in the San Pete valley at the city of Manti, Utah, now reproduced as
Fig. 81. He says:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs near Manti, Utah.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A line drawn horizontally through the middle of the parallel lines connecting the
concentric circles would divide the figure into two halves, each bearing a close<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118">[118]</a></span>
resemblance to Prof. Simpson’s fifth type of cup stones. A copy of the group in
question was made and published by Lieut. J. W. Gunnison, in The Mormons or
Latter-Day Saints, etc., Philadelphia, 1853, p. 63. The illustration is taken from
Bancroft’s Native Races (Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV</span>, p. 717). In accordance with Lieut. Gunnison’s
design, the position of the grotesque human figure is changed to the left of the concentric
circle. He also says that the Mormon leaders made this aboriginal inscription
subservient to their religion by giving the following translation of it: “I,
Mahanti, the second king of the Lamanites, in five valleys of the mountains, make
this record in the twelve hundredth year since we came out of Jerusalem. And I
have three sons gone to the south country to live by hunting antelope and deer.”
* * * Schoolcraft attempts (Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span>, p. 494) something like an interpretation
which appears to me fanciful and unsatisfactory.</p></div>

<p>The following extract is made from The Shinumos by F. S. Dellenbaugh
(<i>a</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some of the least disintegrated ruins are situated on the Colorado river, only
a short distance below the mouth of the Dirty Devil river. * * * A level
shelf varying from about 6 to 10 feet in width ran along for 150 feet or more. In most
places the rocks above protruded as far as the edge of the lower rocks, sometimes
farther, thus leaving a sort of gallery, generally 7 or 8 feet high. Walls that extended
to the roof had been built along the outer edge of the natural floor, and the
inclosed space being subdivided by stone partitions to suit the convenience of the
builders, the whole formed a series of rather comfortable rooms or houses. The back
walls of the houses&mdash;the natural rock&mdash;had on them many groups of hieroglyphics,
and farther along where there was no roof rock at all the vertical faces had been
inscribed with seeming great care. Some of the sheltered groups were painted in
various dull colors, but most of them were chiseled.</p>

<p>The figure [82] gives a chiseled group. It is easy to see that these are signs of no low
order. Considering their great age, their exposure, many of the delicate touches
must be obliterated.</p>

<h4>VIRGINIA.</h4>

<p>In 1886 Dr. Hoffman visited a local field 9 miles southwest of Tazewell,
Tazewell county, Virginia, which can be designated as follows:
The range of hills bounding the western side of the valley presents at
various points low cliffs and exposures of Silurian sandstone. About
4 miles below the village, known as Knob post-office, there is a narrow
ravine leading up toward a depression in the range, forming a pass to
the valley beyond, near the summit of which is a large irregular exposure
of rock facing west-southwest, upon the eastern extremity of which
are a number of pictographs, many of which are still in good preservation.
Fig. 90 is a representation. The westernmost object, i. e.,
the one on the extreme left, appears to be a circle about 16 inches in
diameter, from the outer side of which are short radiating lines giving
the whole the appearance of a sun. Beneath and to the right of this is
the outline of an animal resembling a doe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp178_pg121bh.png">
<img src="images/dp178_pg121b.png" class="hires" width="500" height="134" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in Tazewell county, Virginia.</div>
</div>

<p>Other figures, chiefly human, follow in close succession to the eastern
edge of the vertical face of the rock, nearly all of which present the
arms in various attitudes, i. e., extended or raised as in extreme surprise
or adoration. Concentric rings appear at one point, while a thunder-bird
is shown not far away. About 12 feet east of this place are
several figures resembling the thunder-bird.</p>

<p>All of the characters, with one exception, are drawn in heavy or solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122">[122]</a></span>
lines of dark red paint, presumably a ferruginous coloring material prepared
in the neighborhood, which abounds in iron compounds. The exception
is one object which appears to have been black, but is now so
faded or eroded as to seem dark gray.</p>

<p>The following account of the Tazewell county, Virginia, pictographs
is taken from Coale’s Life, etc., of Waters: (<i>a</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In August, 1871, the writer went to visit Tazewell county by way of the saltworks.
Upon this place are found those strangely painted rocks which have been a
wonder and a mystery to all who have seen them. The grandfather of Gen. Bowen
settled the cove in 1766, one hundred and ten years ago, and the paintings were
there then, and as brilliant to-day as they were when first seen by a white man.
They consist of horses, elk, deer, wolves, bows and arrows, eagles, Indians, and
various other devices. The mountain upon which these rocks are based is about
1,000 feet high, and they lie in a horizontal line about halfway up and are perhaps
75 feet broad upon their perpendicular face.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that the rock is hard, with a smooth white surface, incapable
of absorbing paint, it is a mystery how the coloring has remained undimmed under
the peltings of the elements for how much longer than a hundred years no one
can tell. This paint is found near the rocks, and Gen. Bowen informed the writers
that his grandmother used it for dyeing linsey, and it was a fadeless color.</p>

<p>As there was a battle fought on a neighboring mountain, between 1740 and 1750,
between the Cherokees and Shawnees for the possession of a buffalo lick, the remains
of the rude fortifications being still visible, it is supposed the paintings were hieroglyphics
conveying such intelligence to the red man as we now communicate to
each other through newspapers.</p>

<p>It was a perilous adventure to stand upon a narrow, inclined ledge without a shrub
or a root to hold to, with from 50 to 75 feet of sheer perpendicular descent below to
a bed of jagged bowlders and the home of innumerable rattlesnakes, but I didn’t
make it. I crawled far enough along that narrow slanting ledge with my fingers
inserted in the crevices of the rocks to see most of the paintings, and then “coon’d”
it back with equal care and caution.</p></div>

<p>Five miles east of the last-noted locality and 7 west of Tazewell,
high up against a vertical cliff of rock, is visible a lozenge-shaped
group of red and black squares, known in the locality as the “Handkerchief
rock,” because the general appearance of the colored markings
suggests the idea of an immense bandana handkerchief spread out.
The pictograph is on the same range of hills as the preceding, but
neither is visible from any place near the other. The objects can not
be viewed upon Handkerchief rock excepting from a point opposite to
it and across the valley, as the locality is so overgrown with large trees
as to obscure it from any position immediately beneath. The lozenge
or diamond-shaped figure appears to cover an area about 3 feet in
diameter.</p>


<h4>WASHINGTON.</h4>

<p>Capt. Charles Bendire, U. S. Army, in a letter dated Fort Walla-walla,
Washington, May 18, 1881, mentions a discovery made by Col.
Henry C. Merriam, then lieutenant-colonel Second United States Infantry,
as thus quoted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While encamped at the lower end of Lake Chelan, lat. 48° N., he made a trip to
the upper end of said lake, where he found a perpendicular cliff of granite with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123">[123]</a></span>
perfectly smooth surface, from 600 to 1,000 feet high, rising out of the lake. On the
cliff he found Indian picture-writings, painted evidently at widely different periods,
but evidently quite old. The oldest was from 25 to 30 feet above the present water
level, and could at the time they were executed only be reached by canoe. The
paintings are figures, black and red in color, and represent Indians with bows and
arrows, elk, deer, bear, beaver, and fish, and are from 1 foot to 18 inches in size.
There are either four or five rows of these figures, quite a number in each row.
The Indians inhabiting this region know nothing of the origin of these pictures,
and say that none of their people for the past four generations knew anything about
them.</p></div>

<p>Since the preceding letter was written a notice of the same rock has
been published, together with an illustration, by Mr. Alfred Downing,
of Seattle, Washington, in “The Northwest,” <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span>, No. 10, October, 1889,
pp. 3, 4. The description, condensed, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In that part of Washington territory until recent years known as the Moses Indian
reservation lies the famous Lake Chelan, 70 miles in length with an average
width of 2 miles.</p>

<p>About half a mile from its head, on the western shore and rising from the water, as
an abrupt and precipitous wall of granite, stands “Pictured rock.”</p>

<p>The most remarkable feature of the Chelan picture is that the figures representing
Indians, bear, deer, birds, etc., are painted upon the surface of the smooth
granite, nearly horizontal, but about 17 feet above the lake; the upper portion of
the picture being about 2 feet higher. The figures depicted are 5 to 10 inches long.</p>

<p>The difference between high and low stage of water at any period during the year
does not exceed 4 feet, and this high-water mark being well defined along the shore,
it becomes self-evident that these signs were placed there ages ago, when the water was
17 feet higher than it is now. The granite bluff or walls in this instance are smooth,
being weather and water worn, and afford no hold for hand or foot either from
above or below, and from careful observation it would appear to be a physical
impossibility for either a white or red man to show his artistic skill on those rocks
unless at the ancient stage of water and with the aid of a canoe or a “dugout.”</p>

<p>The paint or color used was black and red, the latter resembling venetian. How
wonderfully the color has stood the test in the face of the storms to which the lake
is subject is apparent; only in one or two instances does it to-day show any signs of
fading or weather-wearing. The signs impressed me as intending to convey the idea
of the prowess of an Indian chief in the hunt, or as being a page in the history of a
tribe, the small perpendicular strokes seen in the lower portion indicating probably
the number of bear, deer, or other animals slain.</p></div>

<p>When referring, in Pacific Railroad Report, vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, page 411, to a
locality on the Columbia river in Washington, between Yakima and
Pisquouse counties, Mr. George Gibbs mentioned pecked and colored
petroglyphs which he found there as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was a perpendicular rock, on the face of which were carved sundry figures, most
of them intended for men. They were slightly sunk into the sandstone and colored,
some black, others red, and traces of paint remained more or less distinctly on all of them.
These also, according to their [the Indians’] report, were the work of the ancient
race; but from the soft nature of the rock, and the freshness of some of the paint,
they were probably not of extreme antiquity.</p></div>

<p>For another example of petroglyphs from Washington see Fig. <a href="#page485">679</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124">[124]</a></span></p>


<h4>WEST VIRGINIA.</h4>

<p>Mr. John Haywood (<i>d</i>) gives the following account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the county of Kenhaway [Kanawha] about 4 miles below the Burning spring,
and near the mouth of Campbell’s creek, in the state of Virginia, is a rock of great
size, on which, in ancient times, the natives engraved many representations. There
is the figure of almost every indigenous animal&mdash;the buffalo, the bear, the deer, the
fox, the hare, and other quadrupeds of various kinds; fish of the various productions
of the western waters, fowls of different descriptions, infants scalped, scalps
alone, and men as large as life. The rock is in the river Kenhaway, near its northern
shore, accessible only at low water unless by the aid of water craft.</p></div>

<p>The following notice of the same locality, but perhaps not of the
same rock, was published by James Madison (<i>a</i>), bishop of Virginia,
in 1804:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I cannot conclude this letter without mentioning another curious specimen of Indian
labour, and of their progress in one of the arts. This specimen is found within 4
miles of the place whose latitude I endeavoured to take, and within 2 of what are
improperly called Burning springs, upon a rock of hard freestone, which sloping to
the south, touching the margin of the river, presents a flat surface of above 12 feet
in length and 9 in breadth, with a plane side to the east of 8 or 9 feet in thickness.</p>

<p>Upon the upper surface of this rock, and also upon the side, we see the outlines
of several figures, cut without relief, except in one instance, and somewhat larger
than the life. The depth of the outline may be half an inch; its width three-quarters,
nearly, in some places. In one line ascending from the part of the rock nearest
the river there is a tortoise; a spread eagle, executed with great expression, particularly
the head, to which is given a shallow relief, and a child, the outline of which is
very well drawn. In a parallel line there are other figures, but among them that of
a woman only can be traced. These are very indistinct. Upon the side of the rock
there are two awkward figures which particularly caught my attention. One is
that of a man with his arms uplifted, and hands spread out as if engaged in prayer.
His head is made to terminate in a point, or rather, he has the appearance of something
upon the head of a triangular or conical form; near to him is another similar
figure suspended by a cord fastened to his heels. I recollected the story which
Father Hennepin relates of one of the missionaries from Canada who was treated in
a somewhat similar manner, but whether this piece of seemingly historical sculpture
has reference to such an event can be only a matter of conjecture. A turkey, badly
executed, with a few other figures may also be seen. The labour and the perseverance
requisite to cut those rude figures in a rock so hard that steel appeared to make
but little impression upon it, must have been great; much more so than making of
enclosures in a loose and fertile soil.</p></div>

<p>Another petroglyph, a copy of which is presented in Fig. 1088, is
thus described in a letter from Morgantown, West Virginia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The famous pictured rocks on the Evansville pike, about 4 miles from this place,
have been a source of wonder and speculation for more than a century, and have
attracted much attention among the learned men of this country and Europe. The
cliff upon which these drawings exist is of considerable size and within a short distance
of the highway above mentioned. The rock is a white sandstone, which
wears little from exposure to the weather, and upon its smooth surface are delineated
the outlines of at least fifty [?] species of animals, birds, reptiles, and fish, embracing
in the number panthers, deer, buffalo, otters, beavers, wildcats, foxes, wolves,
raccoons, opossums, bears, elk, crows, eagles, turkeys, eels, various sorts of fish,
large and small, snakes, etc. In the midst of this silent menagerie of specimens of
the animal kingdom is the full length outline of a female form, beautiful and perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125">[125]</a></span>
in every respect. Interspersed among the drawings of animals, etc., are imitations
of the footprints of each sort, the whole space occupied being 150 feet long by
50 feet wide. To what race the artist belonged or what his purpose was in making
these rude portraits must ever remain a mystery, but the work was evidently done
ages ago.</p></div>

<p>The late P. W. Norris, of the Bureau of Ethnology, reported that he
found petroglyphs in many localities along the Kanawha river, West
Virginia. Engravings are numerous upon smooth rocks, covered during
high water, at the prominent fords in the river, as well as in the niches
or long shallow caves high in the rocky cliffs of this region. Rude
representations of men, animals, and some characters deemed symbolic
were found, but none were observed superior to, or essentially differing
from those of modern Indians.</p>

<p>On the rocky walls of Little Coal river, near the mouth of Big Horse
creek, are cliffs which display many carvings. One of the rocks upon
which a mass of characters appear, is 8 feet in length and 5 feet in
height.</p>

<p>About 2 miles above Mount Pleasant, Mason county, on the north
side of the Kanawha river, are numbers of characters, apparently totemic.
These are at the foot of the hills flanking the river.</p>

<p>On the cliffs near the mouth of the Kanawha river, opposite Mount
Carbon, Nicholas county, are numerous pictographs. These appear to
be cut into the sandstone rock.</p>

<p>Pictographs were lately seen at various points on the banks of the
Kanawha river, both above and below Charleston, but since the construction
of the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad some of the rocks bearing
them have been destroyed. About 6 miles above Charleston there was
formerly a rock lying near its water’s edge upon which, it is reported
by old residents, were depicted the outline of a bear, turkey tracks, and
other markings. Tradition told that this was a boat or canoe landing,
used by the Indians in their travels when proceeding southward. The
tribe was not designated. From an examination of the locality it was
learned that this rock had been broken and used in the construction of
buildings. It is said that a trail passing there led southward, and at
a point 10 miles below the Kanawha river stood several large trees
upon which were marks of red ocher or some similar pigment, at which
point the trail spread or branched out in two directions, one leading
southward into Virginia, the other southwest toward Kentucky.</p>

<p>On a low escarpment of sandstone facing Little Coal river, 6 or 8
miles above its confluence with Coal river and about 18 miles south of
the Kanawha river, are depicted the outlines of animals, such as the
deer, panther (?), etc., and circles, delineated in dark red, but rather
faint from disintegration of the surface. The characters are similar
in general appearance to those in Tazewell county, Virginia, and appear
as if they might have been made by the same tribe. There
are no peculiarities in the topography of the surrounding region that
would suggest the idea of their having served as topographic indications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126">[126]</a></span>
but they rather appear to be a record of a hunting party, and
to designate the kinds of game abounding in the region.</p>

<p>Mr. L. V. McWhorter reports pictographs in a cave near Berlin, Lewis
county, West Virginia. No details are given.</p>

<p>A petroglyph found in a rock shelter in West Virginia is also presented
in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page475">XXXI</a></span>.</p>


<h4>WISCONSIN.</h4>

<p>A large number of glyphs are incised on the face of a rock near
Odanah, now a village of the Ojibwa Indians, 12 miles northeast from
Ashland, on the south shore of lake Superior, near its western extremity.
The characters were easily cut on the soft stone, so were also
easily worn by the weather, and in 1887 were nearly indistinguishable.
Many of them appeared to be figures of birds. An old Ojibwa Indian
in the vicinity told the present writer that the site of the rock was
formerly a well-known halting place and rendezvous, and that on the
arrival of a party, or even of a single individual, the appropriate totemic
mark or marks were cut on the rock, much as white men register
their names at a hotel.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in Brown’s cave, Wisconsin.</div>
</div>

<p>The Pictured cave of La Crosse valley, called Brown’s cave, is described
by Rev. Edward Brown (<i>a</i>) as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This curious cavern is situated in the town of Barre, 4 miles from West Salem and
8 miles from La Crosse. * * *</p>

<p>Before the landslide it was an open shelter cavern, 15 feet wide at the opening and
7 feet at the back end; greatest width, 16 feet; average, 13; length, 30 feet; height,
13 feet, and depth of excavation after clearing out the sand of the landslide, 5 feet.
The pictures are mostly of the rudest kind, but differing in degree of skill. Except
several bisons, a lynx, rabbit, otter, badger, elk, and heron, it is perhaps impossible
to determine with certainty what were intended or whether they represented large
or small animals, no regard being had to their relative sizes.</p>

<p>[Examples of the figures are here presented as Fig. 91.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps <i>a</i> indicates a bison or buffalo, and is the best executed picture of the collection.
Its size is 19 inches long by 15&frac12; inches from tip of the horns to the feet.</p>

<p><i>b</i> represents a hunter, with a boy behind him, in the act of shooting an animal
with his bow and arrow weapon. The whole representation is 25 inches long; the
animal from tip of tail to end of horn or proboscis 12 inches, and from top of head
to feet 7 inches; the hunter 11 inches high, the boy 4&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>c</i> represents a wounded animal, with the arrow or weapon near the wound. This
figure is 21&frac34; inches from the lower extremity of the nose to the tip of the tail, 8&frac34;
inches from fore shoulders to front feet, and 8 inches from the rump to the hind feet.
The weapon is 4&frac12; inches long by 5 inches broad from the tip of one prong or barb to
that of the other.</p>

<p><i>d</i> represents a chief with eight plumes and a war club, 11 inches from top of head
to the lower extremity, and 6&frac34; inches from the tip of the upper finger to the end of
the opposite arm; the war club 6&frac12; inches long.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Hoffman made a visit to this cave in August, 1888, to compare
the pictographic characters with others of apparently similar outline and
of known signification. He found but a limited number of the figures
distinct, and these only in part, owing to the rapid disintegration of
the sandstone upon which they were drawn. Many names and inscriptions
had been incised in the soft surface by visitors, who also, by means
of the smoke of candles, added grotesque and meaningless figures over
and between the original paintings, so as to seriously injure the latter.</p>

<p>Mr. T. H. Lewis (<i>d</i>) describes the petroglyphs, a part of which is reproduced
in Fig. 92, as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/dp184_pg127.png" width="500" height="256" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs at Trempealeau, Wisconsin.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Last November my attention was called to some rock sculptures located about 2&frac12;
miles northwest from Trempealeau, Wisconsin. There is at the point in question an
exposed ledge of the Potsdam sandstone extending nearly one-eighth of a mile along
the east side of the lower mouth of the Trempealeau river, now known as the bay.
Near its north end there is a projection extending out about 7 feet from the top of
the ledge and overhanging the base about 10 feet. The base of the ledge is 40 feet
back from the shore, and the top of the cliff at this point is 30 feet above the water.
On the face of the projection, and near the top, are the sculpture figures referred to.</p>

<p>The characters designated <i>a</i> <i>a</i> are two so-called canoes, somewhat crescent-shaped,
but with some variation in outline; <i>b</i> has the same form, but the additional upright
portion overlaps it; <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> are also of the same form as <i>a</i>, but <i>c</i> is cut in the bottom
of <i>d</i>; <i>e</i> probably represents a fort, and its length is 18&frac12; inches; <i>f</i> is a nondescript,
and it partly overlaps <i>d</i>; <i>g</i> is a nondescript four-legged animal, its length in a
straight line from the end of the nose to the tip of the tail being 10&frac12; inches; <i>h</i> may
be intended to represent a foot, but possibly it may be a hand; it is 7&frac12; inches in
length; <i>i</i> is an outspread hand, a little over 13 inches long; <i>j</i> undoubtedly represents
a foot and is 4&frac12; inches long; <i>k</i> <i>k</i> are of the same class as <i>a</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The figures are not mere outlines, but intaglio, varying in depth from
a quarter of an inch to fully 1 inch. Although the surface of the rock
is rough the intaglios were rubbed perfectly smooth after they had been
engraved by pecking or cutting.</p>


<h4>WYOMING.</h4>

<p>Several pictographs in Wyoming are described by Capt. William A.
Jones, U. S. Army (<i>a</i>). They are reproduced here as Figs. 93, 94,
and 95.</p>

<p>Fig. 93, found in the Wind river valley, Wyoming, was interpreted by
members of a Shoshoni and Banak delegation to Washington in 1880
as “an Indian killed another.” The latter is very roughly delineated
in the horizontal figure, but is also represented by the line under the
hand of the upright figure, meaning the same dead person. At the
right is the scalp taken and the two feathers showing the dead warrior’s
rank. The arm nearest the prostrate foe shows the gesture for
killed; concept, to put down, flat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp185_pg128ah.png">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph in Wind river valley, Wyoming.</div>
</div>

<p>The same gesture appears in Fig. 94, from the same authority and
locality. The scalp is here held forth, and the numeral (1) is indicated
by the lowest stroke.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 95, from the same locality and authority, was also interpreted by
the Shoshoni and Banak. It appears from their description that a
Blackfoot had attacked the habitation of some of his own people. The
right-hand upper figure represents his horse, with the lance suspended
from the side. The lower figure illustrates the log house built against
a stream. The dots are the prints of the horse’s hoofs, while the two
lines running outward from the upper inclosure show that two thrusts
of the lance were made over the wall of the house, thus killing the
occupant and securing two bows and five arrows, as represented in the
left-hand group. The right-hand figure of that group shows the hand
raised in the attitude of making the gesture for kill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in Wind river valley, Wyoming.</div>
</div>

<p>The Blackfeet, according to the interpreters, were the only Indians
in the locality mentioned who constructed log houses, and therefore
the drawing becomes additionally interesting, as an attempt appears
to have been made to illustrate the crossing of the logs at the corners,
the gesture for which (log house) is as follows:</p>

<p>Both hands are held edgewise before the body, palms facing, spread
the fingers, and place those of one hand into the spaces between those
of the other, so that the tips of each protrude about an inch beyond.</p>

<p>Another and more important petroglyph was discovered on Little
Popo-Agie, northwestern Wyoming, by members of Capt. Jones’s party
in 1873. The glyphs are upon a nearly vertical wall of the yellow
sandstone in the rear of Murphy’s ranch, and appear to be of some
antiquity. Further remarks, with specimens of the characters, are
presented below in this paper. (See Fig. <a href="#page678">1091</a>.)</p>

<p>Dr. William H. Corbusier, U. S. Army, in a letter to the writer, mentions
the discovery of drawings on a sandstone rock near the headwaters
of Sage creek, in the vicinity of Fort Washakie, Wyoming, and
gives a copy which is presented as Fig. 96. Dr. Corbusier remarks
that neither the Shoshoni nor the Arapaho Indians know who made the
drawings. The two chief figures appear to be those of the human form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130">[130]</a></span>
with the hands and arms partly uplifted the whole being inclosed
above and on either side by an irregular line.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 96.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph near Sage creek, Wyoming.</div>
</div>

<p>The method of grouping, together with various accompanying appendages,
as irregular lines, spirals, etc., observed in Dr. Corbusier’s
drawing, show great similarity to the Algonquian type, and resemble
some engravings found near the Wind river mountains, which were
the work of Blackfeet (Satsika) Indians, who, in comparatively recent
times, occupied portions of the country in question, and probably also
sketched the designs near Fort Washakie.</p>

<p>Fig. 97 is also reported from the same locality.</p>

<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">MEXICO.</span></h3>

<p>No adequate attention can be given in the present paper to the distribution
and description of the petroglyphs of Mexico. In fact very
little accurate information is accessible regarding them. The distinguished
explorer, Mr. A. Bandelier, in a conversation mentioned that he
had sketched but not published two petroglyphs in Sonora. One, very
large and interesting, was at Cara Pintada, 3 miles southwest of Huassavas,
and a smaller one was at Las Flechas, 1 mile west of Huassavas.
He also sketched one in Chihuahua on the trail from Casas Grandes to
the Cerro de Montezuma. From the accounts of persons met in his
Mexican travels he gave it as his opinion that a large number of petroglyphs
still remained in the region of the Sierra Madre.</p>

<p>The following mention of the paintings of the ancient inhabitants of
Lower California is translated from an anonymous account, in <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Documentos
para la Historia de Mexico</span> (<i>a</i>), purporting to have been written
in 1790:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Throughout civilized California, from south to north, and especially in the caves
and smooth rocks, there remain various rude paintings. Notwithstanding their disproportion
and lack of art, the representations of men, fish, bows and arrows, can
be distinguished and with them different kind of strokes, something like characters.
The colors of these paintings are of four kinds; yellow, a reddish color, green and
black. The greater part of them are painted in high places, and from this it is inferred
by some that the old tradition is true, that there were giants among the
ancient Californians. Be this as it may, in the Mission of Santiago, which is at the
south, was discovered on a smooth rock of great height, a row of hands stamped in
red. On the high cliffs facing the shore are seen fish painted in various shapes and
sizes, bows, arrows, and some unknown characters. In other parts are Indians armed
with bows and arrows, and various kinds of insects, snakes, and mice, with lines and
characters of other forms. On a flat rock about 2 yards in length were stamped insignia
or escutcheons of rank and inscriptions of various characters.</p>

<p>Towards Purmo, about 30 leagues beyond the Mission of Santiago del Sur, is a
bluff 8 yards in height and on the center of it is seen an inscription which resembles
Gothic letters interspersed with Hebrew and Chaldean characters [?].</p>

<p>Though the Californian Indians have often been asked concerning the significance
of the figures, lines, and characters, no satisfactory answer has been obtained. The
most that has been established by their information is that the paintings were their
predecessors, and that they are absolutely ignorant of the signification of them. It
is evident that the paintings and drawings of the Californians are significant symbols
and landmarks by which they intended to leave to posterity the memory, either
of their establishment in this country, or of certain wars or political or natural
triumphs. These pictures are not like those of the Mexicans, but might have the
same purpose.</p></div>

<p>Several petroglyphs in Sonora are described and illustrated infra in
Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page676">XX</a></span> on Special Comparisons. The following copies of petroglyphs
are presented here as specimens and are markedly different from
those in the northwestern states of Mexico, which represent the Aztec
culture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The description of Fig. 98 is extracted from <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viages de Guillelmo
Dupaix</span> (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">

<p>Going from the town of Tlalmanalco to that of Mecamecan, at a distance of a
league to the east of the latter and in the confines of the estate of Señor Don José
Tepatolco, is an isolated rock of granitic stone artificially cut into a conical form
with a series of six steps cut in the solid rock itself on the eastern side, the summit
forming a platform or horizontal section suitable for the purpose of observing the
stars at all points of the compass. It is, therefore, most evident that this ancient
monument or observatory was employed solely for astronomical observations, and it
is further proved by various hieroglyphs cut in the south side of the cone; but the
most interesting feature of this side is the figure of a man standing upright and in
profile directing his gaze to the east with the arms raised, holding in the hands a
tube or species of optical instrument. Beneath his feet is seen a carved frieze with
six compartments or squares and other symbols of a celestial nature are engraved<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133">[133]</a></span>
on their surfaces, evidently the product of observation and calculation. Some of
them have connection with those found symmetrically arranged in circles on the
ancient Mexican calendar, exposed in this capital to general admiration. In front
of the observer is a rabbit seated and confronted by two parallel rows of numerical
figures; lastly two other symbols relating to the same science are seen at the back.</p></div>

<p>Prof. Daniel G. Brinton (<i>a</i>), gives an account of the illustration here
produced on Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV</span> A, which may be thus condensed:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 287px;">
<a href="images/dp192_pg134ph.jpg">
<img src="images/dp192_pg134p.jpg" class="hires" width="277" height="500" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY TENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XIV<br />THE STONE OF THE GIANTS, MEXICO.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The “Stone of the Giants” at Escamela near the city of Orizaba, Mexico, has
been the subject of much discussion. Father Damaso Sotomayor sees in the inscribed
figures a mystical allusion to the coming of Christ to the Gentiles and to the occurrences
supposed in Hebrew myth to have taken place in the Garden of Eden. This
stone was examined by Capt. Dupaix in the year 1808 and is figured in the illustrations
to his voluminous narrative. The figure he gives [now presented as B
on Pl. <i>XIV</i>] is, however, so erroneous that it yields but a faint idea of the real character
and meaning of the drawing. It omits the ornament on the breast and also
the lines along the right of the giant’s face, which as I shall show are distinctive
traits. It gives him a girdle where none is delineated, and the relative size and proportions
of all the three figures are quite distorted.</p>

<p>The rock on which the inscription is found is roughly triangular in shape, presenting
a nearly straight border of 30 feet on each side. It is hard and uniform in
texture and of a dark color. The length or height of the principal figure is 27 feet,
and the incised lines which designate the various objects are deeply and clearly cut.</p>

<p>I now approach the decipherment of the inscriptions. Any one versed in the signs
of the Mexican calendar will at once perceive that it contains the date of a certain
year and day. On the left of the giant is seen a rabbit surrounded with ten circular
depressions. These depressions are the well-known Aztec marks for numerals, and
the rabbit represents one of the four astronomic signs by which they adjusted their
chronologic cycles of fifty-two years. The stone bears a carefully dated record, with
year and day clearly set forth. The year is represented to the left of the figure and
is that numbered “ten” under the sign of the rabbit; the day of the year is number
“one” under the sign of the fish.</p>

<p>These precise dates recurred once, and only once, every fifty-two years, and had
recurred only once between the year of our era, 1450, and the Spanish conquest of
Mexico in 1519-’20. Within the period named the year “ten rabbit” of the Aztec
calendar corresponded with the year 1502 of the Gregorian calendar. It is more difficult
to fix the day, but it is, I think, safe to say that, according to the most probable
computations, the day, “one fish,” occurred in the first month of the year 1502,
which month coincided in whole or in part with our February.</p>

<p>Such is the date on the inscription. Now, what is intimated to have occurred on
that date? The clew to this is furnished by the figure of the giant. It represents
an ogre of horrid mien with a death’s-head grin and formidable teeth, his hair wild
and long, the locks falling down upon the neck. Suspended on the breast as an
ornament is the bone of a human lower jaw, with its incisor teeth. The left leg is
thrown forward as in the act of walking, and the arms are uplifted, the hands open,
and the fingers extended as at the moment of seizing the prey or the victim. The
lines about the umbilicus represent the knot of the girdle which supported the
<i>maxtli</i> or breechcloth.</p>

<p>There is no doubt as to which personage of the Aztec pantheon this fear-inspiring
figure represents. It is <i>Tzontemoc Mictlantecutli</i>, “the Lord of the Realm of the
Dead, He of the Falling Hair,” the dread god of death and the dead. His distinctive
marks are there, the death’s-head, the falling hair, the jaw bone, the terrible aspect,
the giant size.</p>

<p>We possess several chronicles of the empire before Cortes destroyed it, written in
the hieroglyphs which the inventive genius of the natives had devised. Taking two<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134">[134]</a></span>
of these chronicles, one known as the Codex Telleriano-Remensis, the other as the
Codex Vaticanus, I turn to the year numbered “ten” under the sign of the rabbit
and I find that both present the same record which I copy in the following figure.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.</span>&mdash;The Emperor Ahuitzotzin.</div>
</div>

<p>The figure so copied is entitled “Extract from the Vatican Codex,”
which is a slight error. It is a copy from the Codex Telleriano-Remensis,
Kingsborough, <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, Pt. 4, p. 23, year 1502, which is here reproduced
as Fig. 99. The record in the Vatican Codex, Kingsborough, <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>,
p. 130, differs in some unimportant details. It may also be noted that
in the text relating to the Codex Telleriano-Remensis, Kingsborough,
<span class="smcap lowercase">VI</span>, p. 141, the word Ahuitzotl is given as “the name of an aquatic
animal famous in Mexican mythology.” The present opportunity is
embraced to recognize the acumen displayed by Prof. Brinton in his
interpretation of the petroglyph. He proceeds as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sign of the year (the rabbit) is shown merely by his head for brevity. The
ten dots, which give its number, are beside it. Immediately beneath is a curious
quadruped, with what are intended as water-drops dripping from him. The animal
is the hedgehog, and the figure is to be constructed <i>iconomatically</i>; that is, it must
be read as a rebus through the medium of the Nahuatl language. In that language
water is <i>atl</i>, in composition <i>a</i>, and hedgehog is <i>uitzotl</i>. Combine these and you get
<i>ahuitzotl</i>, or, with the reverential termination, <i>ahuitzotzin</i>. This was the name of
the ruler or emperor, if you allow the word, of ancient Mexico before the accession
to the throne of that Montezuma whom the Spanish <i>conquistador</i>, Cortes, put to
death.</p>

<p>Returning to the page from the chronicle, we observe that the hieroglyph of
Ahuitzotzin is placed immediately over a corpse swathed in its mummy cloths, as
was the custom of interment with the highest classes in Mexico. This signifies that
the death of Ahuitzotzin took place in that year. Adjacent to it is the figure of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135">[135]</a></span>
successor, his name iconomatically represented by the headdress of the nobles, the
<i>tecuhtli</i>, giving the middle syllables of “<i>Mo-tecuh-zoma</i>.” No doubt is left that
<i>La Piedra de los Gigantes</i> of Escamela is a necrologic tablet commemorating the death
of the Emperor Ahuitzotzin, some time in February, 1502.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Eugène Boban (<i>a</i>) mentions manuscript copies, dating from the beginning
of the century, of various sculptured stones in Mexico. These
sculpturings represent native ideographic characters, among them the
<i>teocalli</i>, the <i>tepetl</i>, the sign <i>ollin</i>, etc.</p>

<p>On several of the plates which compose this collection are notes indicating
the place where the monument, fragment, or ruin is found, from
which the characters are copied; for example, one of them bears the
note: “de la calle R<sup>l</sup> de la villa de Cuernabaca.” Several others bear
annotations which show that they have been copied in the cemetery,
in the streets of that town, or in its environs.</p>

<p>Aside from these notes the plates are not accompanied by any information
which could give a trace of the person who drew them, or the purpose
for which they were intended.</p>

<p>The same author (<i>b</i>) describes a large sculptured stone of Mexico,
the designs on which have been reproduced in paintings on deerskin.
After giving a detailed description of the copied MS. he speaks of the
stone as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We deem it of interest to give some notes concerning the famous cylindrical stone,
both sculptured and painted, known by the name <i>Teocuauhxicalli</i> (the sacred drinking
vase of the eagles) on which are found the themes of all the designs which have
been above described. This stone, buried at the time of the Spanish Conquest, was
discovered in the first half of this century at the close of a series of excavations
made in the soil of the Place d’Armes, Mexico. The director of the national museum,
who was then M. Rafael Gondra, contented himself with taking the dimensions and
making a hurried sketch of it. It was then reinterred, as the necessary funds were
lacking to exhume it entirely and transport it to the museum.</p>

<p>The name Teocuauhxicalli is composed of: <i>Teotl</i>, god; <i>cuauhili</i>, eagle, and <i>xicalli</i>,
hemispherical vase formed from the half of a gourd. It may be translated by,
“The vase of god and the eagles,” or, rather, “The sacred drinking cup of the
eagles.”</p>

<p>“The Mexican monarch Axayacatl, jealous of his predecessor Motecuhzoma I,
took down the Teocuauhxicalli which was in the upper part of the Great Temple of
Mexico, and replaced it by another, sculptured by his order;” so says the eminent
Mexican archæologist and historian, Don Manuel Orozco y Berra, in his excellent
work, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Historia Antigua y de la Conquesta de Mexico</span> (t. <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span>, p. 348). This monument
was also dedicated to the god of war, Huitzilopochtli.</p>

<p>According to Duran and Tezozomoc, those stones on which gods were represented
were designated by the name Teocuauhxicalli; i. e., divine cuauhxicalli. They belonged
to the class of painted stones, for they were covered with several colors.</p>

<p>Orozco y Berra adds the following: “It is evident that the figures sculptured and
painted do not represent armed warriors preparing for combat. On the contrary, we
see that they represent gods. Among them is found Huitzilopochtli (god of war)
with his arms and attributes, having before him another deity or high priest who holds
in his hands the emblems of the holocaust.</p>

<p>“The figures of the upper part are not fighting and could not have known how
to fight, if we judge by their positions; the chest is turned back, the face raised
toward the sky, in which appears an object which resembles the astronomical sign
<i>cipactli</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Everywhere on the surface of this stone are noticed symbols, birds, quadrupeds,
fantastic reptiles, signs of the sun, days, months, and a quantity of objects whose
character is imitated in manuscripts and rituals. There can be no doubt that we are
in the presence of a monument devoted to the gods and bearing legends relative to
their worship. M. the minister of Fomento, D. Vicente Rivera Palacio, in 1877
made several attempts at excavation in the Plaza Mayor of Mexico, to recover this
important monument, but all search remained unfruitful.”</p>

<p>This stone is supposed to be buried beneath the Place d’Armes at Mexico.</p></div>

<p>Mexican petroglyphs are also discussed and figured by Chavero (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>It would seem from these and other descriptions of and allusions to
petroglyphs in Mexico, that at the time of the Spanish conquest they
were extant in large numbers, though now seldom found. Perhaps the
Spaniards destroyed them in the same spirit which led them to burn up
many of the Mexican pictographs on paper and other substances.</p>

<p>A number of illustrations of the Mexican pictographic writings are
given below under various headings.</p>


<h3>SECTION 4.<br />
<span class="subhead">WEST INDIES.</span></h3>

<p>The valuable paper of A. L. Pinart (<i>a</i>), giving a description of the
petroglyphs found by him in the Greater and Lesser Antilles, is received
too late for reproduction of the illustrations. He explored a number of
the groups of the West Indies with varying success, but found that the
island of Puerto Rico was the one which now furnishes the greatest
amount of evidence of development in the pictographic art. His
marks translated with condensation appear below.</p>


<h4>PUERTO RICO.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first petroglyph to be mentioned is found at la Cueva del Islote, on Punta
Braba, about 5 leagues east from Arecibo and on the north side of the island of Puerto
Rico. The grotto is found in an immense blackish mass of igneous rock, forming a
point projecting into the sea, which beats furiously against it; it communicates
with the sea at the foot, and the water entering this passage, which is quite narrow,
produces a terrific roaring followed soon after by veritable thunder claps. The
people of the neighborhood have a superstitious fear of it, and it is only with great
difficulty that anyone can be found to accompany one there. The entrance on
the land side is toward the east&mdash;a yawning crevasse, filled partly with rubbish
and partly by the stunted vegetation of the coast. On penetrating to the interior
we find, after following a short but wide passage, a pyriform chamber 20
meters in diameter. In the ceiling a very narrow crack admits a ray of light which,
reflected in the water of the sea, filling the bottom of the cave, produces a bluish
twilight. Notwithstanding this twilight, we are obliged to carry torches to distinguish
objects. All around us, but especially over the point where the sea enters in,
are to be seen the inscriptions represented here. The incisions are very deep, and
the edges are generally dulled by the blows of the hammer; in certain spots, toward
the lower part of the grotto, several inscriptions are partially effaced by the action
of the sea, but those of the upper part are in a remarkable state of preservation.
Beneath certain principal figures of the groups are little circular basin-like depressions
cut in the rock with a trench running down toward the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>I will not attempt here to give a formal explanation of these inscriptions, but may
we not regard the spot in which they are found as having served for a rendezvous
for the ancient Borrinqueños where they performed their sacrifices or the ceremonies
of their religion? On the other hand, the appearance of these inscriptions is very
peculiar. One of them might be considered a representation of those little figurines
and statuettes of stone found in Mexico, in Mixteca, and in the country to the south.
In another a head is curiously decorated with a diadem of feathers, and apparently
represents one presiding at a feast served in the small circular basin set before him.
The most noticeable thing in this group of inscriptions is the frequency of the grinning
faces in a circle, often alone, often accompanied by two others placed at the
sides, which are universally met with in every inscription found in the Greater and
Lesser Antilles. The same may be said of the human figure apparently swaddled
in cloths like a very young infant, the head and body more or less decorated, which
is also very frequently found.</p>

<p>Following these petroglyphs of Islote, we present a list of others discovered at
Puerto Rico, hastily describing them and giving a particular description only of those
which are of the greatest interest.</p>

<p>In the above-mentioned grotto of Cueva de los Archillas, near the village of
Ciales, we observed the curious figures bearing traces of a crown and peculiar ear
ornaments. In la Cueva de los Conejos, some distance from Arecibo, on the road
from Utauado, we found a figure partly incised and partly painted in a dark red; it
is very artistically fashioned, and represents the famous “guava,” the monster
spider of the Greater Antilles, of which the natives have a great dread. It is probable
that the ancient Borrinqueños also considered it with a certain awe, and we find
images of the same animal in la Cueva del Templo on the coast of Haiti, at Santo
Domingo. A solitary rock of a reddish color, in a field of the hacienda of Don Pedro
Pavez at la Carolina, a short distance from the Rio Pedras, bears a series of grimacing
faces in circles. On a granitic rock of large dimensions, superimposed on a heap
of rocks of the same character, in the midst of a grove of Indian trees and at the entrance
of the Cano del Indio into Rio la Ceiba, near Fajardo, on the east side, are
found three swaddled human figures, the heads decorated with various ornaments.
On a black rock in the Rio Arriba, one of the branches of the Rio de la Ceiba, is a
petroglyph which presents but little that is of interest.</p>

<p>On the Loma Muñoz, near the Rio Arriba above mentioned, and on the summit of
the hill, stands a dark rock with smooth face protected by another mass of rock,
forming a sort of shelter on which is an inscription composed of a number of incised
grinning faces. At the confluence of the Rio Blanco and the Rio de la Ceiba, in the
district of Fajardo, is a series of violent rapids formed by immense rocks of a granitic
character, on which are cut a large number of other grimacing faces and also some
swaddled figures, and other incisions which are not of interest.</p></div>


<h4>BAHAMA ISLANDS.</h4>

<p>Lady Edith Blake, wife of Sir Henry Arthur Blake, formerly governor
of the Bahama islands, has kindly furnished the following information
and sketches (Figs. 100, 101, and 102), relating to petroglyphs in the
Bahama islands. Lady Blake says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The carvings are on the walls of an “Indian hole,” also called Hartford cave, in
the northern shore of a small island in Rum Cay, one of the Bahama group. Rum
Cay measures 5 miles from north to south and about 8 or 9 from east to west. It
lies 20 miles northwest of Watlings island, the San Salvador of Columbus.</p>

<p>The cave is situated on the seashore about a mile and a half from the western
point of the island to the eastward of a bluff, close to which is a “puffing hole,”
through which the waves blow when the seas roll in from the north. The cave is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138">[138]</a></span>
semicircular in shape and about 20 yards in depth, and is partially filled with debris
of rocks, earth, and sand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp197_pg138ah.png">
<img src="images/dp197_pg138a.png" class="hires" width="500" height="237" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in the Bahamas.</div>
</div>

<p>Like all rocks of which the Bahamas are formed, those in Hartford cave are a mixture
of coral, detritus, and shell, very rough and full of cracks and indentations, and
in this cave, from the constant damp of filtration and spray, the walls were coated
with a deposit of lime and salt, so that it would be impossible to say if the carvings
had been colored. If ever they had been, any traces of coloring must long have
disappeared. Besides the markings copied there were others scattered over the walls
of the cave, most of which were circles apparently resembling human faces. Unfortunately,
we neglected to measure the carvings, but I should judge the circles or
faces to be 10 inches or more across, while others of the figures must have been a foot
and a half in length, and the markings must have been nearly half an inch in depth,
cut into the face of the rock, and seemed to us such as might have been made with a
sharp stone implement. Although we visited numerous caves in the various islands
of the Bahamas, in no other did we find any appearance of markings or carvings on
the walls, nor could we hear of any reported to have such markings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in the Bahamas.</div>
</div>

<p>The absence of any traces of carvings in other caves whose situation was better
adapted for the preservation of markings, had such ever existed, and the proof that
their contents afforded that most of those caves had been known to the Lucayans
and used by them as burying places or otherwise, and the close proximity of Hartford
cave to the sea, taken in connection with the great number of markings on its
walls, led me to think that possibly this cave had been the resort of the marauding
tribes whom the Lucayans gave Columbus to understand were their enemies, and
who were in the habit of making war upon them; and if so, the Caribs, or whatever
tribe it may have been, had left these rock markings as mementos of their various
expeditions and guides to succeeding ones.</p></div>

</div>

<p>The above-mentioned petroglyphs bear a remarkable similarity to
those in British Guiana figured and described below, and the authorship
would seem to relate to the same group of natives, the Caribs.</p>


<h4>GUADELOUPE.</h4>

<p>In the Guesde collection of antiquities, described in the Smithsonian
report for 1884, p. 834, Fig. 208, here reproduced as Fig. 103, is an inscribed
slab found in Guadeloupe. It weighs several tons and it is impossible
to remove it. In the vicinity are to be seen many other rocks
bearing inscriptions, but this is the most elaborate of the group.</p>

<p>The inscriptions may be compared with those from Guiana presented
in this work.</p>

</div>


<h4>ARUBA.</h4>

<p>Pinart (<i>b</i>) gives the following account, translated and condensed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The island of Aruba forms one of the group of the islands of Curaçao, on the north
coast of Venezuela. This group consists of three principal islands, Curaçao, Buen
Ayre, Aruba, and some isolated rocks. It belongs to Holland.</p>

<p>Aruba is the most western island of the group and is situated opposite the peninsula
of Paraguana, on the mainland. The distance between the two is about 10
leagues, and from the island the shores of the continent can be seen very distinctly.</p>

<p>These islands, at the time of the discovery by the Spaniards, were inhabited by an
Indian race which has left numerous traces of its occupancy; pottery, stone objects,
petroglyphs, etc., are met with in large numbers in Aruba and in a less quantity on
Buen Ayre and Curaçao. * * * These petroglyphs are quite different in character
from those which I have recently described in a brief study of the Greater and Lesser
Antilles, and their appearance brings to mind those found in Orinoco, in Venezuela,
in the peninsula of Paraguana, on the border of the Magdalena river, and as far as
Chiriqui. They differ from these, however, in several respects, and especially in
that they are almost always multi-colored. The colors usually employed are red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140">[140]</a></span>
blue, a yellowish white, and black. They are, moreover, painted and not cut in the
rock. They show the same degree of variance as I have already noticed in North
America&mdash;in Sonora, Arizona, and Chihuahua&mdash;between the petroglyphs which I have
designated as Pimos, which are always incised, and those in the mountains which
I designated as Comanche, and which are always painted and in many colors. The
petroglyphs are, as has already been said, very numerous on the island of Aruba. I
have personal knowledge of thirty, but, according to my friend Père van Kolwsjk,
there must be more than fifty. The most important groups are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Avikok.</i> An enormous dark rock forms the summit of a wooded knob, and in
this rock are two large cavities, one above the other, on the walls of which are the
petroglyphs represented.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Fontein.</i> On the border of a fresh-water lagoon, a short distance from the
northeast part of the island, near the sea, is a grotto of coralline origin, whose walls
are of remarkable whiteness. This grotto is composed of a principal passage, quite
wide, cut off toward the lower end by a row of stalactites and stalagmites, which,
joining together, form a curious grimacing figure. On the wall to the left, as we
look toward the bottom of the grotto, are found some petroglyphs. They are well
preserved, thanks to their situation and the shelter from inclement weather, and
they show no indication of painting, being distinctly traced on the walls.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Chiribana.</i> On some granitic spurs of a hill of the same name are found curious
petroglyphs.</p>

<p>(4) At Lero de Wajukan, near Avikok, and at the foot of a hill, petroglyphs are
found on some blocks of granite. I notice specially the human figure which in the
original is outlined in red and bears on the shoulder a hatchet of the Carib type
with a haft.</p>

<p>(5) At Ayo I discovered petroglyphs with figures in blue and red.</p>

<p>(6) At Woeboeri inscriptions are found on the wall of an immense mass of granite.</p>

<p>(7) Some petroglyphs on the walls of a grotto at Karasito.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="subhead">PETROGLYPHS IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.</span></h2>


<p>Some writers have endeavored to draw definite ethnic distinctions
between the pre-Columbian inhabitants of North America and those
farther south. The opinions and theories which have favored such discriminations
have originated in error and ignorance. Until lately there
has been but scanty scientific investigation of the peoples of Central and
South America and but a limited exploration of the regions now or
formerly occupied by them. The latest opinion of the best ethnologists
is that no sufficient reason can be shown for separate racial classification
of the aborigines of the three Americas. The examples of petroglyphs
now presented from Central and South America, all of which
are selected as typical, show remarkable similarity to some of those
above illustrated and described, especially to those in California, New
Mexico, and Arizona. This topic is further discussed under the heading
of Special Comparison, Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page676">XX</a></span>, infra.</p>


<h3>SECTION I.<br />

<span class="subhead">PETROGLYPHS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.</span></h3>


<h4>NICARAGUA.</h4>





<p>Dr. J. F. Bransford (<i>a</i>) gives the following
account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On a hillside on the southern end of the island of
Ometepec, Nicaragua, about 1&frac12; miles east of Point
San Ramon, are many irregular blocks of basalt with
marks and figures cut on them. The hillside faces
east, and is about half a mile from the lake. There
were similar markings on many of the shore rocks,
which, in May, were partially covered with water,
notwithstanding that that was about the driest season.
These markings were excavated about half an
inch in depth and a little more in width. Human
faces and spiral lines predominated. There was also
a crown, a representation of a monkey, and many
irregular figures.</p></div>

<p>Several illustrations from these rocks are
presented, infra, in Figs. <a href="#page686">1102</a> and <a href="#page686">1103</a>, and one is reproduced in this
connection as Fig. 104.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142">[142]</a></span></p>


<h4>GUATEMALA.</h4>

<p>The following extract is taken from the work of Dr. S. Habel (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Santa Lucia is a village in the Republic of Guatemala, in the Department of
Esquintla, near the base of the Volcano del Fuego, at the commencement of the
inclined plane which extends from the mountain range to the coast of the Pacific
Ocean. * * *</p>

<p>The sculptured slabs are in the vicinity of the village. The greater number of
them form an extended heap, rendering it probable that there are others hidden
from view that more extended researches would reveal. * * * All the sculptures,
with the exception of three statues, are in low relief, nearly all being in cavo-relievo,
that is, surrounded by a raised border, the height of which indicates the
elevation of the relief. The same kind of relief was practiced by the ancient
Assyrians and Egyptians.</p>

<p>In seven instances the sculpture represents a person adoring a deity of a different
theological conception in each case. One of these seems to represent the sun, another
the moon, while in the remaining five it is impossible to define their character. All
these deities are represented by a human figure, of which only the head, arms, and
breast are correctly portrayed, proving that the religious conceptions had risen to
anthropomorphism, while the idols of the nations of Central America and Mexico,
which have previously come to our knowledge, are represented by disfigured human
forms or grotesque images.</p>

<p>Four of the other sculptures represent allegorical subjects; two of them the myth
of the griffin, the bird of the sun.</p>

<p>The slabs on which the low reliefs are sculptured are of various sizes; the greater
number of these, like those representing the deities, are 12 feet in length, 3 feet in
width, and 2 feet in thickness. Nine feet of the upper part of these stones are occupied
by the sculptures, while the lower 3 feet appear to have served as a base.</p></div>

<p>Several illustrations of these rock sculptures are presented, infra, as
Figs. <a href="#page730">1235</a> and <a href="#page731">1236</a>. It is evident that these very large slabs received
their markings when they were in the locality in which they are now
found so can be classed geographically.</p>


<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">SOUTH AMERICA.</span></h3>

<p>Alexander von Humboldt (<i>a</i>) gives general remarks, now condensed,
upon petroglyphs in South America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the interior of South America, between the second and fourth degrees of north
latitude, a forest-covered plain is inclosed by four rivers, the Orinoco, the Atabapo,
the Rio Negro, and the Cassiquiare. In this district are found rocks of granite and
of syenite, covered with colossal symbolical figures of crocodiles and tigers, and
drawings of household utensils, and of the sun and moon. The tribes nearest to its
boundaries are wandering naked savages, in the lowest stages of human existence,
and far removed from any thoughts of carving hieroglyphics on rocks. One may
trace in South America an entire zone, extending through more than 8° of longitude,
of rocks so ornamented, viz, from the Rupuniri, Essequibo, and the mountains
of Pacaraima, to the banks of the Orinoco and of the Yupura. These carvings
may belong to very different epochs, for Sir Robert Schomburgk even found on the
Rio Negro representations of a Spanish galiot, which must have been of a later date
than the beginning of the sixteenth century; and this in a wilderness where the natives
were probably as rude then as at the present time. Some miles from Encaramada<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143">[143]</a></span>
there rises in the middle of the savannah the rock Tepu-Mereme, or painted rock.
It shows several figures of animals and symbolical outlines which resemble much
those observed by us at some distance above Encaramada, near Caycara. Rocks
thus marked are found between the Cassiquiare and the Atabapo and, what is particularly
remarkable, 560 geographical miles farther to the east, in the solitudes of
Parime. Nicholas Hortsmann found on the banks of the Rupunuri, at the spot
where the river winding between the Macarana mountains forms several small
cascades, and before arriving at the district immediately surrounding lake Amucu,
“rocks covered with figures,” or, as he says in Portuguese, “<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">de varias letras</span>.” We were
shown at the rock of Culimacari, on the banks of the Cassiquiare, signs which were
called characters, arranged in lines, but they were only ill-shaped figures of heavenly
bodies, boa-serpents, and the utensils employed in preparing manioc meal. I have
never found among these painted rocks (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">piedras pintadas</span>) any symmetrical arrangement
or any regular even-spaced characters. I am therefore disposed to think that
the word “<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">letras</span>,” in Hortsmann’s journal, must not be taken in the strictest sense.</p>

<p>Schomburgk saw and described other petroglyphs on the banks of the Essequibo,
near the cascade of Warraputa. Neither promises nor threats could prevail on the
Indians to give a single blow with a hammer to these rocks, the venerable monuments
of the superior mental cultivation of their predecessors. They regard them
as the work of the Great Spirit, and the different tribes whom we met with, though
living at a great distance, were nevertheless acquainted with them. Terror was
painted on the faces of my Indian companions, who appeared to expect every moment
that the fire of heaven would fall on my head. I saw clearly that my endeavors
to detach a portion of the rock would be fruitless, and I contented myself with
bringing away a complete drawing of these memorials. Even the veneration everywhere
testified by the Indians of the present day for these rude sculptures of their
predecessors show that they have no idea of the execution of similar works. There
is another circumstance which should be mentioned. Between Encaramada and
Caycara, on the banks of the Orinoco, a number of these hieroglyphical figures are
sculptured on the face of precipices at a height which could now be reached only by
means of extraordinarily high scaffolding. If one asks the natives how these figures
have been cut, they answer, laughing, as if it were a fact of which none but a white
man could be ignorant, that “in the days of the great waters their fathers went in
canoes at that height.”</p></div>


<h4>UNITED STATES OF COLOMBIA.</h4>

<p>Mr. W. H. Holmes (<i>b</i>), of the Bureau of Ethnology, gives this account
of petroglyphs in the province of Chiriqui, state of Panama:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Pictured rocks.</i>&mdash;Our accounts of these objects are very meager. The only one
definitely described is the “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">piedra pintal</span>.” A few of the figures engraved upon it
are given by Seemann, from whom the following paragraph is quoted:</p>

<p>“At Caldera, a few leagues (north) from the town of David, lies a granite block
known to the country people as the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">piedra pintal</span> or painted stone. It is 15 feet
high, nearly 50 feet in circumference, and flat on the top. Every part, especially
the eastern side, is covered with figures. One represents a radiant sun; it is followed
by a series of heads, all with some variations, scorpions, and fantastic figures.
The top and the other side have signs of a circular and oval form, crossed by lines.
The sculpture is ascribed to the Dorachos (or Dorasques), but to what purpose the
stone was applied no historical account or tradition reveals.”</p>

<p>These inscriptions are irregularly placed and much scattered. They are thought
to have been originally nearly an inch deep, but in places are almost effaced by
weathering, thus giving a suggestion of great antiquity. Tracings of these figures
made recently by Mr. A. L. Pinart show decided differences in detail, and Mr. McNiel
gives still another transcription.</p></div>

<h4>GUIANA.</h4>

<p>The name of Guiana has been applied to the territory between the
rivers Amazon, Orinoco, Negro, and Cassiquiare. It was once divided
into the French, British, Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish Guianas.
The Portuguese Guiana now belongs to Brazil and Spanish Guiana is
part of Venezuela. Many petroglyphs have been found in the several
Guianas. They appear throughout the whole of the part belonging to
Venezuela, but they are more thickly grouped in parts of the valley of
the Orinoco.</p>

<p>The subject is well discussed in the following extract from Among
the Indians of Guiana, by im Thurn (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The pictured rocks of Guiana are not all of one kind. In all cases various figures
are rudely depicted on larger or smaller surfaces of rocks. Sometimes these figures
are painted, though such cases are few and of but little moment; more generally
they are graven on the rock, and these alone are of great importance. Rock sculptures
may, again, be distinguished into two kinds, differing in the depth of incision,
the apparent mode of execution, and, most important of all, the character of the
figures represented.</p>

<p>Painted rocks in British Guiana are mentioned by Mr. C. Barrington Brown. He
says that in coming down past Amailah fall, on the Cooriebrong river, he passed “a
large white sandstone rock ornamented with figures in red paint.” * * * Mr.
Wallace, in his account of his Travels on the Amazons, mentions the occurrence of
similar drawings in more than one place near the Amazons. * * *</p>

<p>The engraved rocks must be of some antiquity; that is to say, they must certainly
date from a time before the influence of Europeans was much felt in Guiana. As has
already been said, the engravings are of two kinds and are probably the work of
two different people; nor is there even any reason to suppose that the two kinds
were produced at one and the same time.</p>

<p>These two kinds of engravings may, for the sake of convenience, be distinguished
as “deep” and “shallow,” respectively, according as the figures are deeply cut into
the rock or are merely scratched on the surface. The former vary from one-eighth
to one-half of an inch, or even more, in depth; the latter are of quite inconsiderable
depth. This difference probably corresponds with a difference in the means by
which they were produced. The deep engravings seem cut into the rock with an
edged tool, probably of stone; the shallow figures were apparently formed by long<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145">[145]</a></span>
continued friction with stones and moist sand. The two kinds seem never to occur
in the same place or even near to each other; in fact, a distinct line may almost be
drawn between the districts in which the deep and shallow kinds occur, respectively;
the deep form occurs at several spots on the Mazeruni, Essequibo, Ireng, Cotinga,
Potaro, and Berbice rivers. The shallow form has as yet only been reported from
the Corentyn river and its tributaries, where, however, examples occur in considerable
abundance. But the two kinds differ not only in the depth of incision, in the
apparent mode of their production, and in the place of their occurrence, but also&mdash;and
this is the chief difference between the two&mdash;in the figures represented.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 106 is a typical example of the shallow carvings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<a href="images/dp204_pg145h.png">
<img src="images/dp204_pg145.png" class="hires" width="420" height="500" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 106.</span>&mdash;Shallow carvings in Guiana.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#page686">1104</a>, infra, is a similar example of the deep carvings.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The shallow engravings seem always to occur on comparatively large and more
or less smooth surfaces of rock, and rarely, if ever, as the deep figures, on detached
blocks of rock, piled one on the other. The shallow figures, too, are generally much
larger, always combinations of straight or curved lines in figures much more elaborate
than those in the deep engravings; and these shallow pictures always represent
not animals, but greater or less variations of the figure which has been described.
Lastly, though I am not certain that much significance can be attributed to this, all
the examples that I have seen face more or less accurately eastward.</p>

<p>The deep engravings, on the other hand, consist not of a single figure but of a greater
or less number of rude drawings. * * * These depict the human form, monkeys,
snakes, and other animals, and also very simple combinations of two or three straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146">[146]</a></span>
or curved lines in a pattern, and occasionally more elaborate combinations. The individual
figures are small, averaging from 12 to 18 inches in height, but a considerable
number are generally represented in a group.</p>

<p>Some of the best examples of this latter kind are at Warrapoota cataracts, about
six days’ journey up the Essequibo.</p>

<p>* * * The commonest figures at Warrapoota are figures of men or perhaps
sometimes monkeys. These are very simple and generally consist of one straight line,
representing the trunk, crossed by two straight lines at right angles to the body
line; one about two-thirds of the distance from the top, represents the two arms as
far as the elbows, where upward lines represent the lower part of the arms; the
other, which is at the lower end, represent the two legs as far as the knees, from
which point downward lines represent the lower part of the legs. A round dot, or a
small circle, at the top of the trunk line, forms the head; and there are a few radiating
lines where the fingers, a few more where the toes, should be. Occasionally the
trunk line is produced downwards as if to represent a long tail. Perhaps the tailless
figures represent men, the tailed monkeys. In a few cases the trunk, instead of
being indicated by one straight line, is formed by two curved lines, representing the
rounded outlines of the body; and the body thus formed is bisected by a row of
dots, almost invariably nine in number, which seem to represent vertebræ.</p>

<p>Most of the other figures at Warrapoota are very simple combinations of two, three,
or four straight lines similar to the so-called “Greek meander pattern,” which is of
such widespread occurrence. Combinations of curved and simple spiral lines also
frequently occur. Many of these combinations closely resemble the figures which
the Indians of the present day paint on their faces and naked bodies.</p></div>

<p>The same author (pp. 368, 369) gives the following account of the
superstitious reverence entertained for the petroglyphs by the living
Indians of Guiana:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Every time a sculptured rock or striking mountain or stone is seen, Indians avert
the ill will of the spirits of such places by rubbing red peppers (<i>Capsicum</i>) each in
his or her own eyes. * * * Though the old practitioners inflict this self-torture
with the utmost stoicism, I have again and again seen that otherwise rare sight of
Indians children, and even young men, sobbing under the infliction. Yet the ceremony
was never omitted. Sometimes, when by a rare chance no member of the party
had had the forethought to provide peppers, lime juice was used as a substitute; and
once, when neither peppers nor limes were at hand, a piece of blue indigo-dyed
cloth was carefully soaked, and the dye was then rubbed into the eyes.</p></div>

<p>The same author (<i>b</i>) adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It may be as well briefly to sum up the few facts that can be said, with any probability,
of these rock pictures in Guiana. The engravings are of two kinds, which
may or may not have had different authors and different intention. They were still
produced after the first arrival of Europeans, as is shown by the sculptured ship.
They were, therefore, probably made by the ancestors of the Indians now in the
country; for, from the writings of Raleigh and other early explorers, as well as from
the statements of early colonists, it is to be gathered that the present tribes were
already in Guiana at the time of the first arrival of Europeans, though not perhaps
in the same relative positions as at present. The art of stone-working being destroyed
by the arrival of Europeans, the practice of rock-engraving ceased. Possibly
the customary figures were for a time painted instead of engraved; but this degenerated
habit was also soon relinquished. As to the intention of the figures, that they
had some seems certain, but what kind this was is not clear. Finally, these figures
really seem to indicate some very slight connection with Mexican civilization.</p></div>

<p>The following extract from a paper on the Indian picture-writing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147">[147]</a></span>
British Guiana, by Mr. Charles B. Brown (<i>a</i>), gives views and details
somewhat different from the foregoing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These writings or markings are visible at a greater or less distance in proportion
to the depth of the furrows. In some instances they are distinctly visible upon the
rocks on the banks of the river at a distance of 100 yards; in others they are so faint
that they can only be seen in certain lights by reflected rays from their polished
surfaces. They occur upon greenstone, granite, quartz-porphyry, gneiss, and jasperous
sandstone, both in a vertical and horizontal position, at various elevations
above the water. Sometimes they can only be seen during the dry season when the
rivers are low, as in several instances on the Berbice and Cassikytyn rivers. In one
instance, on the Corentyn river, the markings on the rock are so much above the
level of the river when at its greatest height, that they could only have been made
by erecting a staging against the face of the rock, unless the river was at the time
much above its usual level. The widths of the furrows vary from half an inch to 1
inch, while the depth never exceeds one-fourth of an inch. * * * The furrows
present the same weather-stained aspect as the rocks upon which they are cut. * * *</p>

<p>The Indians of Guiana know nothing about the picture-writing by tradition.
They scout the idea of their having been made by the hand of man, and ascribe them
to the handiwork of the Makunaima, their great spirit. * * *</p>

<p>As these figures were evidently cut with great care and at much labor by a former
race of men, I conclude that they were made for some great purpose, probably a
religious one, as some of the figures give indications of phallic worship.</p></div>


<h4>VENEZUELA.</h4>

<p>Prof. R. Hartmann (<i>a</i>) presented a pencil drawing of a South American
rock, covered with sculptures, sketched by Mr. Anton Goering, a
painter in Leipzig, which is here reproduced as Fig. 107. The rock is
situated not far from San Esteban, a village in the vicinity of Puerto
Cabello, in Venezuela. C. F. Appun, in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unter den Tropen</span>, I, p. 82,
remarks as follows in reference to this “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Piedra de los Indios</span>” (Indians’
stone), a large granite block lying by the side of the road:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp206_pg147h.jpg">
<img src="images/dp206_pg147.jpg" class="hires" width="500" height="260" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 107.</span>&mdash;Sculptured rock in Venezuela.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These drawings, cut in the stone to a depth of half an inch, mostly represent
snakes and other animal forms, human heads and spiral lines, and differ from those
which I afterward saw in Guiana, on the Essequibo and Rupununi, in characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148">[148]</a></span>
and forms, but their execution, like that of the latter, is rude. Though greatly
weathered by the influence of rain and the atmosphere, the figures can still be perfectly
distinguished and gigantic patience, such as none but Indians possess, was
surely needed to carve them in the hard granite mass by means of a stone.</p></div>

<p>Dr. G. Marcano (<i>a</i>) gives an account translated as follows, which is
connected with Fig. 108:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp207_pg148h.png">
<img src="images/dp207_pg148.png" class="hires" width="500" height="122" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 108.</span>&mdash;Rock near Caïcara, Venezuela.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A tradition, the legend of the rock of Tepumereme, has been preserved by Father
Gili. Some old writers, adhering to the Tamanak acceptation of the word, say
indifferently tepumeremes or <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">rocas pintadas</span> (painted rocks). Usage has converted
Tepumereme into a proper noun. At the present day it is applied exclusively to the
rock situated some leagues from Encaramada, in the midst of the savanna, this rock
having been the Mount Ararat of the Tamanaks.</p>

<p>Supposing that it is authentic, this legend, which we will relate further on [see
<a href="#page033">page 33</a>, supra], yields no information that might aid us in interpreting hieroglyphs,
and so we are reduced to describing its principal characters.</p>

<p>Not all our pictographs correspond to the region of the Raudals, but in our ignorance
of the peoples who carved them we see no harm in bringing them together so
long as they all come from the banks of the Orinoco, and so long as the localities
where they exist are indicated. The copies which we give of them have been very
carefully made and reduced to one-tenth.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes one on looking at them is that, despite differences in
detail, the design presents a general common character. In fact, there is question not
of figures with undecided forms, but with sure lines perfectly traced and combined in
one and the same style. They are geometric designs rather than objective representations.
The illustration [Fig. 108] came from a rock in the vicinity of Caïcara,
a town situated on the right bank of the Orinoco, close to its last great bend. It
represents three jaguars, one large and two small, the former being separated from
the latter by an ornamented sun placed at the level of their feet. The spotting of
their hides is rendered by means of angular lines arranged in so regular a manner
that one might take them to be tigers did he not know that these felines never existed
in these regions. The jaguars differ in insignificant details which, however,
must have a purpose, in view of the general regularity. The largest shows six radiating
lines on the muzzle and a circle in one of the ears. The second shows two
hooks on the lower part of the body. The third is preceded by an isolated head,
which is unfinished, without ears, inclined differently from the others. Some differences
are also noted in the limbs.</p>

<p>Placed in the attitude of marching, these animals seem to descend from a height
and to follow the same direction. Perhaps there is question here of a mnemonic
whole, and, we might add, of a totem, if we knew that that system had been employed
by the Indians of the region.</p></div>

<p>The same author (p. 205) gives a description of the petroglyphs of the
rapids of Chicagua, here presented as Fig. 109.</p>

<p>This interesting collection includes the most varied ideographs.</p>

<p>Alongside of representations analogous to the preceding there appear new characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149">[149]</a></span>
and partial groupings which we had not yet found. On running over them one
passes successively from simple points to figures made up of tangled lines, to objective
representations, and even to letters of the alphabet, a resemblance which, of course,
is fortuitous.</p>

<p>The first group begins by three points similar to those in Fig. 19 [of Marcano, occurring
in Fig. <a href="#page687">1105</a> in this paper], followed by two circles with central dots, and terminates
below in a plexus of broken lines. The second group, placed at the right, is
composed of regular figures of great variety. Among them we note the two lowest,
one of which resembles a K and the other a reversed A. A spiral, two circles, one of
which has two appendices, and a figure in broken lines make up the third group.
Below is seen a coiled serpent. Its head is characteristic; it is found in other pre-Columbian
carvings of the Orinoco. As regards design e, we will merely call attention
to the sign analogous to the E of our alphabet. It is found at times in the
United States of America. [For this remark the author refers to the ideograph for
pain, in Figs. <a href="#page576">824</a> and <a href="#page589">872</a>, infra.]</p>

<p>Design <i>f</i> is an animal difficult to characterize; its head and tail may be guessed
at. The body is covered with ornaments and the legs, very incomplete, are in the
attitude of running. Design <i>g</i> represents probably a tree with an appendix of undulating
lines; design <i>h</i>, a head surmounted by a complicated headgear. This is
the first distinctly human representation that we have found in the country. The
strange combinations of designs <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, and <i>l</i> exhibit the dots at the end of the lines
which we have already spoken of. Design <i>m</i> resembles an M; design <i>n</i> shows a
circle with plane face.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the statements of some travelers concerning mysterious hieroglyphic
combinations are far from being realized. As regards the exaggerations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150">[150]</a></span>
Humboldt, they arise from the fact that he did not content himself with describing
what he had seen. This is illustrated by the following sentence: “There is even
seen on a grassy plain near Uruana an isolated granite rock on which, according
to the account of <i>trustworthy people</i>, there are seen at a height of 80 feet deeply
carved images which appear arranged in rows and represent the sun, the moon, and
different species of animals, especially crocodiles and boas.” Elsewhere he speaks
of kitchen and household utensils and of a number of objects which he can only
have seen with the eyes of his imagination.</p></div>

<h4>BRAZIL.</h4>

<p>Remarks of general applicability to this region are made by Mr. J.
Whitfield (<i>a</i>), an abstract of which follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The rock inscriptions were visited in August, 1865. Several similar inscriptions
are said to exist in the interior of the province of Ceará, as well as in the provinces
of Pernambuco and Piauhy, especially in the Sertaōs, that is, in the thinly-wooded
parts of the interior, but no mention is ever made of their having been seen near the
coast.</p>

<p>In the margin and bed only of the river are the rocks inscribed. On the margin
they extend in some instances to 15 or 20 yards. Except in the rainy season the
stream is dry. The rock is a silicious schist of excessively hard and flinty texture.
The marks have the appearance of having been made with a blunt, heavy tool, such
as might be made with an almost worn-out mason’s hammer. The situation is about
midway between Serra Grande or Ibiapaba and Serra Merioca, about 70 miles from
the coast and 40 west of the town Sobral. The native population attribute all the
“<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Letreiros</span>” (inscriptions), as they do everything else of which they have no information,
to the Dutch, as records of hidden wealth. The Dutch, however, only occupied
the country for a few years in the early part of the seventeenth century. Along the
coast numerous forts, the works of the Dutch, still remain; but there are no authentic
records of their ever having established themselves in the interior of the country, and
less probability still of their amusing themselves with inscribing puzzling hieroglyphics,
which must have been a work of time, on the rocks of the far interior, for
the admiration of wandering Indians.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Franz Keller (<i>a</i>) narrates as follows regarding Fig. 110:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp210_pg151ah.jpg">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 110.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs on the Cachoeira do Ribeirão, Brazil.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I found a “written rock” covered with spiral lines and concentric rings, evenly
carved in the black gneiss-like material, and similar to those of the Caldeirão.
Looking about for more, I discovered a perfect inscription, whose straight orderly
lines can hardly be thought the result of lazy Indians’ “hours of idleness.” These
characters were incised on a very hard smooth block 3 feet 4 inches in length, and
3&frac14; feet in height and breadth. It lay at an angle of 45°, only 8 feet above low water,
and close to the water’s edge of the second smaller rapid, the Cachoeira do Ribeirão.
The transverse section of the characters is not very deep, and their surface is as worn
as that of the inscription farther down. In some places they are almost effaced by
time and are to be seen distinctly only with a favorable light. A dark brown coat
of glaze, found everywhere on the surface of the stones, laved at times by the water,
covers the block so uniformly well on the concave glyphs as on the parts untouched
by instrument, that many ages must have elapsed since some patient Indian spent
long hours in cutting them out with his quartz chisel. As the lines of the inscription
run almost perfectly horizontally, and as the figures near the Caldeirão and the
Cachoeira and the Cachoeira das Lages are so little above low-water mark, the
present position of the block seems to have been the original one. * * * On the
rocky shores of the Araguaya, that huge tributary of the Tocantino, there are similar
rude outlines of animals near a rapid called Martirios, from the first Portuguese explorers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151">[151]</a></span>
fancying they recognized the instruments of the Passion in the clumsy representation.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Ladisláu Netto (<i>a</i>) gives the illustration, reproduced as Fig. 111, of
an inscription discovered by Domingos S. Ferreira Penna on the rock
called Itamaraca, on the Rio Xingu. Dr. Netto’s description is translated
as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 305px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152">[152]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>This whole inscription seems to represent one idea, figuring a collection of villages
of vast proportions, inclosed by fortifications on two sides, at which it seems most
accessible. On these same sides this collection of villages has external constructions
or means of security, a kind of meanders or symbolic figures, which perhaps
signify difficulties besetting the communication of the inhabitants with the surrounding
fields.</p>

<p>In the lower part of the left-hand side there is a group of figures which seem to
represent residences of chiefs, war houses, or redoubts, built near the principal
entrance to the villages or to the city for its defense. There are found three figures
of saurians, one with a large tail, on the side of the redoubts or fortified houses, as
if representing the population, and two with small tails, which seem strange, and
which walk toward the first.</p>

<p>This inscription is evidently the most perfect and the most notable of those found
till now in all America [?], not only by its perfect condition and dimensions, but
also by the mode in which a series of ideas has here been brought together.</p></div>

<p>The same author, on p. 552, furnishes copies
of inscriptions carved on stones in the valley
of the Rio Negro, and remarks: “In this series
there are notable the two crowned personages
[represented here in Fig. 112], one of whom holds
a staff in the right hand, and below and under
them there are two figures of capibars (sea-hogs)
facing each other, and whose representation in
black color resembles some figures from the inscriptions
of North America.”</p>

<p>Having no small canoe
we could not pass a small
channel so as to gather
copies of the figures we
could see at a distance.
The approaches both above
and below the rapids and
falls are many times as difficult
to pass as the rapid
or fall itself, giving rise to
the division into “head,”
“body,” and “tail.” Some
not only have these divisions,
but also have these
subdivided into “head,
body, and tail.” One is
constantly hearing “el rabo,”
“el rabo del rabo,”
“el rabo del cuerpo,” or
“cabeza,” and so on.</p>

a continuous broken current
and fields of rocks. It
is here, on a rock but a foot

that the hieroglyphic
shown in F. Keller’s “Amazon
and Madeira” is found.
As both Mr. Fetterman and myself made copies of it, unknown to the other till
finished, our copies may be relied on, although differing from Keller’s. The length<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155">[155]</a></span>

On a ridge of rocks in the middle of the river, just above Larges rapids, are
figures, and we had only time to sketch one, Fig. 118.</p>

<p>At Pao Grande we had a better harvest, showing evidently a later period than
the former. One could easily believe these were made at the time of the Spanish
conquest, the anchors, shields, and hearts being so often found in Spanish religious
rites. Without doubt these were notices for navigators, as they were only out of
water and seen when that passage was dangerous. Where projecting points of rock
gave a face both up and down stream the same figure was on both faces. These
rocks are syenitic granite and are cut to a depth of a half inch.</p></div>

of which, with translations, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the province of Ceará district of Inhamun, on the plantation

<h4>PERU.</h4>

<p>The following account is furnished by Messrs. de Rivero and Von
Tschudi (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Eight leagues north of Arequipa there exist a multitude of engravings on granite
which represent figures of animals, flowers, and fortifications, and which doubtless
tell the story of events anterior to the dynasty of the Incas.</p></div>

</div>

<p>The account is continued as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the province of Castro-Vireyna, in the town of Huaytara, there is found in the
ruins of a large edifice, of similar construction to the celebrated palace of old Huanuco,
a mass of granite many square yards in size, with coarse engravings like those last
mentioned near Arequipa. None of the most trustworthy historians allude to these inscriptions
or representations, or give the smallest direct information concerning the
Peruvian hieroglyphics, from which it may possibly be inferred that in the times of
the Incas there was no knowledge of the art of writing in characters and that all of
these sculptures are the remains of a very remote period. * * * In many parts
of Peru, chiefly in situations greatly elevated above the sea are vestiges of inscriptions
very much obliterated by time.</p></div>

<p>Charles Wiener (<i>a</i>), in Pérou et Bolivie, gives another statement,
viz:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The archeologists of Peru have only found a single point&mdash;Tiahuanaco&mdash;where
there were a limited number, though very interesting, of signs on rocks or stones
which seemed to all observers to be symbolic. While there are a few petroglyphs
found in Peru there are a large number of inscriptions properly so called on the
tissues which cover or are found in connection with remains in the graves.</p></div>

translated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I made a visit to the valley “Cajon de los Cipreses” in order to see the glacier
giving rise to the Rio de los Cipreses, a tributary of the Cachapoal, and on that occasion
had a cursory view of a rock with some pictures. I send you herewith a drawing
of the rock and some of the figures cut on it. The rock, a kind of greenstone,
lies at an altitude of about 5,000 feet above sea level, and the surface covered with
figures, gently inclined down to the ground, may be 8 feet long and 5 or 6 feet high.
The lines are about 4 mm. broad and 1 to &frac12; mm. deep. The carved figures on the stone
are without any sort of order. When I spoke before a meeting of our faculty of physical
and mathematical sciences concerning this stone which the shepherds of the region
called <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">piedra marcada</span>, I learned that similar stones with carved figures are
found in various places.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="subhead">EXTRA-LIMITAL PETROGLYPHS.</span></h2>


<p>The term “extra-limital,” familiar to naturalists, refers in its present
connection to the sculptures, paintings, and drawings on rocks beyond
the continents of North and South America, which are now introduced
for comparison and as evidence of the occurrence throughout the world
of similar forms in the department of work now under examination.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">AUSTRALIA.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Edward G. Porter (<i>a</i>), in “The Aborigines of Australia,” says:
“Their rock carvings are only outline sketches of men, fish, animals,
etc., sometimes seen on the top of large flat rocks. Two localities are
mentioned, one on Sydney common and another on a rock between
Brisbane water and Hawkesbury river.”</p>

<p>Much more detailed information is given by Thomas Worsnop, viz:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At Chasm island, which lies 1&frac12; miles from “Groote Eylandt,” in the steep sides of
the chasms, were deep holes or caverns undermining the cliffs, upon the walls of
which are found rude drawings, made with charcoal and something like red paint,
upon the white ground of the rock. These drawings represented porpoises, turtle,
kangaroos, and a human hand, and Mr. Westall found the representations of a kangaroo
with a file of thirty-two persons following after it.</p>

<p>In the MacDonnell ranges, 6 miles from Alice springs, in a large cave, there were
paintings made by the aborigines, well defined parallel lines, intersected with footprints
of the emu, kangaroo rat, and birds, with the outlines of iguana, hands of
men, well sketched and almost perfect.</p>

<p>The parallel lines were of deep red and yellow colors, with brown and white borders;
the footprints of light red, light yellow, and black; the outlines of the animals
and hands were of red, yellow, white, black, wonderfully (considering it was
done by savages) displayed and blended. All the paintings were in good preservation
and evidently touched up occasionally, as they looked quite fresh.</p>

<p>I can only conjecture that these paintings were left as a record, a life-long charm,
against the total destruction of the above animals. The paintings were seen by Mr.
S. Gason, of Beltana, in the year 1873.</p>

<p>Very interesting groups of native drawings are to be seen in the caves of the
Emily gorge in the MacDonnell ranges. Many of these drawings represent life-size
objects.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The same author, page 20, describes the petroglyph copied in Fig.
130 as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<a href="images/dp221_pg162h.jpg">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 130.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph on Finke river, Australia.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Arthur John Giles in the year 1873 discovered, at the junction of Sullivan’s
creek with the Finke river, carvings on rocks. The sketch represents a smooth-faced
rock, portion of a rock cliff about 45 feet high, composed of hard metamorphic
slate. The lower portion of the sculptured face has been worn and broken away,
forming a sort of cave. From the level of the creek to the lower edge of the sculptured
rock is about 15 feet. The perpendicular lines are cut out, forming semicircular
grooves about 1&frac12; inches in diameter, cut in to a depth of nearly half an inch;
all remaining figures are also carved into the solid rock to a depth of one-fourth of
an inch.</p></div>

<p>The same author, page 14, gives the following description of some
pictures discovered between 1831 and 1840 by Capt. Stokes on Depuch
island, one of the Forestier group in Dampier archipelago, on
the western coast of Australia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Depuch island would seem to be their favorite resort, and we found several of
their huts still standing. The natives are doubtless attracted to the place partly by
the reservoirs of water they find among the rocks after rain; partly that they may
enjoy the pleasure of delineating the various objects that attract their attention on
the smooth surface of the rocks. This they do by removing the hard red outer coating
and baring to view the natural color of the greenstone, according to the outline<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163">[163]</a></span>
they have traced. Much ability is displayed in many of these representations, the
subject of which could be discovered at a glance. The number of specimens are immense,
so that the natives must have been in the habit of amusing themselves in
this innocent manner for a long period of time.</p>

<p>These savages of Australia, who have adorned the rocks of Depuch island with
their drawings, have in one thing proved themselves superior to the Egyptian and
the Etruscan, whose works have elicited so much admiration and afforded food to
so many speculations, namely, there is not in them to be observed the slightest trace
of indecency.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 131.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in Depuch island, Australia.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 131 shows a number of the characters drawn on these rocks.
They are supposed to represent objects as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>a</i>, a goose or duck; <i>b</i>, a beetle; <i>c</i>, a fish, with a quarter moon over, considered to
have some reference to fishing by moonlight; <i>d</i>, a native, armed with spear and wommera
or throwing stick, probably relating his adventures, which is usually done by
song and accompanied with great action and flourishing of weapons, particularly
when boasting of his powers; <i>e</i>, a duck and a gull; <i>f</i>, a native in a hut, with portion
of the matting with which they cover their habitations; <i>g</i>, shark and pilot fish; <i>h</i>,
a corroboreeo or native dance; <i>i</i>, a native dog; <i>j</i>, a crab; <i>k</i>, a kangaroo; <i>l</i>, appears
to be a bird of prey, having seized upon a kangaroo rat.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The same author, page 5, describes another locality as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In New South Wales, in the neighborhood of Botany bay and port Jackson, the
figures of animals, of shields and weapons, and even of men, have been found carved
upon the rocks, roughly, indeed, but sufficiently well to ascertain very fully what
was the object intended. Fish were often represented, and in one place the form of
a large lizard was sketched out with tolerable accuracy. On top of one of the hills
the figure of a man, in the attitude usually assumed by them when they begin to
dance, was executed in a still superior style.</p></div>

<p>The figure last mentioned was probably the god Daramūlŭn, see
Howitt, Australian Customs of Initiation (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>A special account of the aboriginal rock carvings at the head of
Bantry bay is furnished by R. Etheridge, jr. (<i>a</i>), as follows, the illustration
referred to being presented here as Fig. 132:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 132.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs at Bantry bay, Australia.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of the numerous traces of aboriginal rock carvings to be seen on the shores of Port
Jackson, none probably equal in extent or completeness of detail those on the heights
at the head and on the eastern side of Bantry bay, Middle harbor, Australia.</p>

<p>The table of sandstone over which the carvings are scattered measures 2 chains
in one direction by 3 in the contrary, and has a gentle slope of 7 degrees to the southwest.
The high road as now laid out passes over a portion of them. * * *</p>

<p>The figures are represented in their present state in outline by a continuous indentation
or groove from 1 to 1&frac12; inches broad by half an inch to 1 inch in depth. Some
are single subjects scattered promiscuously over the surface; others form small
groups, illustrating compound subjects, but all appear to have been executed about
one and the same time. * * *</p>

<p>An advance on the other sculptures existing at this place seems to be made in the
originals of the designs <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, from the fact that an attempt was apparently made to
represent a compound idea in the form of a single combat between two warriors. The
figures are quite contiguous to one another. The individual marked <i>a</i> seems to be
holding in his right hand a body similar to that represented as <i>c</i>, and the position in
which it is held would lend color to the belief in its shield-like nature. In the opposite
hand are a bundle of rods which have been suggested to be spears, and this
explanation for the want of a better may be accepted. On the other hand, we are
confronted with the fact that these weapons of offense and defense are held in the
wrong hands, unless the holder be regarded as sinistral; otherwise it must be conceived
that the warrior’s back is presented to the observer, which is contrary to the
other evidence existing in the carving. The opponent, marked as <i>b</i>, with legs astride
and arms outstretched much in the position of an aboriginal when throwing the
boomerang, is equally definitive. I conceive it quite possible that the position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165">[165]</a></span>
the boomerang close to the right hand conveys the idea that this man has just
thrown the missile at the subject of <i>a</i>, allowing, of course, for the want of a knowledge
of perspective on the part of the aboriginal artist. * * *</p>

<p>In several other figures the head is a mere rounded outline, but in <i>b</i> it is presented
with a rather bird-like appearance. Another peculiarity is the great angularity
given to the kneecap: this is visible both in <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. It is further exemplified in
the elbow of the left arms of both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">OCEANICA.</span></h3>

<p>The term “Oceanica” is used here without geographic precision, to
include several islands not mentioned in other sections of the present
work, in different parts of the globe, where specially interesting petroglyphs
have been found and made known in publications. Although
more such localities are known than are now mentioned, the pictographs
from them are not of sufficient importance to justify description or illustration,
but it may be remarked that they show the universality of the
pictographic practice.</p>


<h4>NEW ZEALAND.</h4>

<p>Dr. Julius von Haast (<i>a</i>) published notes, condensed as follows, descriptive
of the illustration produced here as Fig. 133:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The most remarkable petroglyphs found in New Zealand are situated about 1 mile
on the western side of the Weka Pass road in a rock shelter, which is washed out of
a vertical wall of rock lining a small valley for about 300 feet on its right or southern
side. The whole length of the rock below the shelter has been used for painting,
and it is evident that some order has been followed in the arrangement of the subjects
and figures. The paint consists of kokowai (red oxide of iron), of which the
present aborigines of New Zealand make still extensive use, and of some fatty substance,
such as fish oil, or perhaps some oily bird fat. It has been well fixed upon
the somewhat porous rock and no amount of rubbing will get it off.</p>

<p>Some of the principal objects evidently belong to the animal kingdom, and represent
animals which either do not occur in New Zealand or are only of a mythical or fabulous
character. The paintings occur over a face of about 65 feet, and the upper end
of some reaches 8 feet above the floor, the average height, however, being 4 to 5
feet. They are all of considerable size, most of them measuring several feet, and one
of them even having a length of 15 feet.</p>

<p>Beginning at the eastern end in the left-hand corner is the representation <i>a</i> of
what might be taken for a sperm whale with its mouth wide open diving downward.
This figure is 3 feet long. Five feet from it is another figure <i>c</i>, which might also
represent a whale or some fabulous two-headed marine monster. This painting is
3 feet 4 inches long. Below it, a little to the right in <i>d</i>, we have the representation
of a large snake possessing a swollen head and a long protruding tongue. This figure
is nearly 3 feet long, and shows numerous windings.</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive how the natives in a country without snakes could not
only have traditions about them but actually be able to picture them, unless they
had received amongst them immigrants from tropical countries who had landed on
the coasts of New Zealand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the two fishes or whales is <i>b</i>, which might represent a fishhook, and below
the snake <i>d</i> a sword <i>e</i> with a curved blade.</p>

<p>Advancing toward the right is a group which is of special interest, the figure <i>i</i>,
which is nearly a foot long, having all the appearance of a long-necked bird carrying
the head as the cassowary and emu do, and as the moa has done. If this design
should represent the moa, I might suggest that it was either a conventional way of
drawing that bird or that it was already extinct when this representation was
painted according to tradition; in which latter case <i>k</i> might represent the taniwha
or gigantic fabulous lizard which is said to have watched the moa. <i>h</i> is doubtless
a quadruped, probably a dog, which was a contemporary of the moa and was used
also as food by the moa hunters. <i>j</i> is evidently a weapon, probably an adz or tomahawk,
and might, being close to the supposed bird, indicate the manner in which
the latter was killed during the chase. The post, with the two branches near the top
<i>l</i>, finds a counterpart in the remnant of a similar figure <i>g</i> between the figures <i>c</i> and <i>i</i>.
They might represent some of the means by which the moa was caught or indicate
that it existed in open country between the forest. <i>m</i>, under which the rock in the
central portion has scaled off, is like <i>f</i>, one of the designs which resemble ancient
oriental writing.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 133.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph in New Zealand.</div>
</div>

<p>Approaching the middle portion of the wall we find here a well-shaped group of
paintings, the center of which <i>n</i> has all the appearance of a hat ornamented on the
crown. The rim of this broad-brimmed relic measures 2 feet across. The expert of
ancient customs and habits of the Malayan and South Indian countries might perhaps
be able to throw some light upon this and the surrounding figures, <i>o</i> to <i>r</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>q</i>, which is altogether 3 feet high, evidently issues fire or smoke; it therefore
might represent a tree on fire, a lamp or an altar with incense offering. * * *
The figure <i>o</i> is particularly well painted, and the outlines are clearly defined, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167">[167]</a></span>
can make no suggestion as to its meaning. In <i>s</i> we have, doubtless, the picture of
a human being who is running away from <i>q</i>, the object from the top of which issues
fire or smoke. I am strengthened in my conviction that it is meant for a man by
observing a similar figure running away from the monster <i>aa</i>. <i>p</i>, which has been
placed below that group, might be compared to a pair of spectacles, but is probably
a letter or an imitation of such a sign.</p>

<p>A little more to the right a figure 6 feet long is very prominent. It is probably the
representation of a right whale in the act of spouting. Above it, in <i>v</i>, the figure of
a mantis is easily recognizable, whilst <i>u</i> and the characters to the right below the supposed
right whale again resemble cyphers or letters. <i>w</i> and <i>y</i>, although in many
respects different, belong doubtless to the same group, and represent large lizards or
crocodiles. * * * <i>w</i> is 4 feet long; it is unfortunately deficient in its lower portion,
but it is still sufficiently preserved to show that besides four legs it possesses
two other lower appendages, of which one is forked and the other has the appearance
of a trident. I wish also to draw attention to the unusual form of the head.
<i>y</i> is a similar animal 3 feet long, but it has eight legs, and head and tail are well defined.
The head is well rounded off, and both animals represent, without doubt,
some fabulous animal, such as the taniwha, which is generally described as a huge
crocodile, of which the ancient legends give so many accounts.</p>

<p><i>aa</i>, a huge snake-like animal 15 feet long, is probably a representation of the
tuna tuoro, a mythical monster. It is evident that the tuna tuoro is in the act of
swallowing a man, who tries to save himself by running away from it.</p></div>


<h4>KEI ISLANDS.</h4>

<p>Mr. A. Langen (<i>a</i>) made a report on the Kei islands and their Ghost
grottoes, with a plate now reproduced as Fig. 134. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The group of the small Kei islands, more correctly Arue islands [southwest from
New Guinea], is a sea bottom raised by volcanic forces and covered with corals and
shells. The corals appear but at a few points. They are in the main covered with
a layer of shells cemented together, whose cement is so hard and firm that it offers
resistance to the influence of time even after the shell has been weathered away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 319px;">
<a href="images/dp227_pg168h.png">
<img src="images/dp227_pg168.png" class="hires" width="319" height="500" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 134.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in Kei islands.</div>
</div>

<p>On the whole, all the figures in similar genre are represented in thousands of
specimens. [They may be divided into three series, the first including letters <i>a</i> to
<i>k</i>; the second, letters <i>l</i> to <i>t</i>; the third, letters <i>u</i> to <i>cc</i>.] Many are effaced and unrecognizable,
only letter <i>k</i>, series 1; letters <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, series 2; and letters <i>cc</i>, series 3, stand
isolated and seem to have a peculiar meaning. The popular legend ascribes the greatest
age to the characters of series 1 and series 2, and it is said that the signs record
a terrible fight in which the islanders lost many dead, but yet remained victors. It
is stated that the signs were produced by the ghosts of the fallen. The signs of series
3 are said to be the work of a woman named Tewaheru, who was able to converse
with ghosts as well as with the living. But, when on one occasion she helped a
living man to recover his dead wife by betraying to him the secret of making the
spirit return to the body, she is said to have been destroyed by the ghosts and
changed into a blackbird, whose call even at this day indicates death. Since that
time no medium is said to exist between the living and the dead, nor do any new
signs appear on the rock.</p>

<p>Investigation in place showed me that the color of series 3 consists of ocher made
up with water. The very oldest drawings seem to have been made with water
color, as the color has nowhere penetrated into the rock. Most of the figures are
painted on overhanging rocks in such a way as to be protected as much as possible
against wind and weather; whether they bear any relation to the signs on the rocks
of Papua, and what that relation may be, I am not yet able to judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>It may safely be assumed that the caves as abodes of spirits were sacred, but did
not serve as places of burial. The lead rings and pieces of copper gongs found in
small number before some of the caves seem to be derived from sacrifices offered to
the spirits. At the present day no more sacrifices are offered there, and the islanders
knew nothing of the existence of these things.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169">[169]</a></span></p>


<h4>EASTER ISLAND.</h4>

<p>In this island carved human figures of colossal size have been frequently
noticed in various publications, with and without illustrations,
but apart from those statues ancient stone houses remain in which
have been found large stone slabs bearing painted figures. Paymaster
William J. Thompson, U. S. Navy (<i>a</i>) says of the Orongo houses,
that the “smooth slabs lining the walls and ceilings were ornamented
with mythological figures and rude designs painted in white, red,
and black pigments.” The figures partake of the form of fish and bird-like
animals, the exaggerated outlines clearly indicating mythologic
beings, the type of which does not exist in nature. Fig. 135 is presented
here, extracted by permission from the work above cited, and it
may be of interest to know that nearly all, if not all, of the original
specimens are now deposited in the U. S. National Museum.</p>

</div>

<p>While the curious carvings on the wooden tablets which are discussed
in the work of Paymaster Thompson are not petroglyphs, it
seems proper to mention them in this connection. Fig. 136 is taken
from <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mittheilungen der Anthropologischen Gesellschaft, in Wien</span> (<i>a</i>),
and shows one of the tablets, which does not appear to be presented
in this exact form in the work before mentioned.</p>

</div>

<p>The following remarks by Prof. de Lacouperie (<i>b</i>) are quoted on account
of the eminence of his authority, though the subject is still under
discussion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The character of eastern India, the Vengi-Châlukya, was also carried to north
Celebes islands. The people have not remained at the level required for the practical
use of a phonetic writing. It is no more used as an alphabet. Curiously
enough, it is employed as pictorial ornaments on the MSS. they now write in a pictographic
style of the lowest scale. This I have seen on the facsimile (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bilderschriften
des Ostindischen Archipels</span>, Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, 1, 11) published by Dr. A. B. Meyer, of Dresden,
in his splendid album on the writings of this region.</p>

<p>In the Easter island, or Vaihu, some fourteen inscriptions have been found incised
on wooden boards, perhaps of driftwood. The characters are peculiar. Most of them
display strange shapes, in which, with a little imagination, forms of men, fishes,
trees, birds, and many other things have been fancied. A curious characteristic is
that the upper part of the signs are shaped somewhat like the head of the herronia
or albatross. A pictorial tendency is obvious in all of these. Some persons in Europe
have taken them for hieroglyphics, and have ventured to find a connection
with the flora and fauna of the island. The knowledge of this writing is now lost;
and it is not sure that the few priests and other men of the last generation who
boasted of being able to read them could do so thoroughly. Anyhow, in 1770, some
chiefs were still able to write down their names on a deed of gift when the island
was taken in the name of Carlos III of Spain.</p>

<p>In examining carefully the characters I was struck by the forked heads of many
of them, which reminded me of the forked matras of the Vengi-Châlukya inscriptions.
A closer comparison with Pls. i to viii of the Elements of South Indian
Paleography (A. C. Burnell, Elements of South Indian Paleography, from the
fourth to the seventeenth century A. D., being An Introduction to the Study of
South Indian Inscriptions and MSS., 2d edit., London and Mangalore, 1878; Pls. i, vii,
viii are specially interesting for the forked matras) soon showed me that I was on
the right track, and a further study of the Vaihu characters, and their analysis by
comparing the small differences (vocalic notation) existing between several of them,
convinced me that they are nothing else than a decayed form of the above writing
of southern India returning to the hieroglyphical stage. With this clue, the inscriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171">[171]</a></span>
of Easter island are no more a sealed text. They can easily be read after
a little training. Their language is Polynesian, and I can say that the vocabulary
of the Samoan dialect has proved very useful to me for the purpose.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">EUROPE.</span></h3>

<p>In the more settled and civilized parts of Europe petroglyphs are now
rarely found. This is, perhaps, accounted for in part by the many occasions
for use of the inscribed rocks or by their demolition during the
long period after the glyphs upon them had ceased to have their original
interest and significance and before their value as now understood
had become recognized. Yet from time to time such glyphs have been
noticed, and they have been copied and described in publications.</p>

<p>But few of the petroglyphs in the civilized portions of Europe not
familiar by publication have that kind of interest which requires their
reproduction in the present paper. It may be sufficient to state in general
terms that Europe is no exception to the rest of the world in the
presence of petroglyphs.</p>

<p>A number of these extant in the British islands and in the Scandinavian
peninsula, besides the few examples presented in this chapter,
are described and illustrated in other parts of this work, and brief accounts
of others recently noted in France, Spain, and Italy are also
furnished.</p>


<h4>GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.</h4>

<p>Nearly all of the petroglyphs found in the British islands, accounts
of which have been published, belong to the class of cup sculptures
discussed in Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page189">V</a></span>, infra, but several inscriptions showing characters
not limited to that category are mentioned in “Archaic Rock Inscriptions,”
(<i>a</i>) from which the following condensed extract referring to a
cairn in county Meath, Ireland, is taken:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ornamentation may be thus described: Small circles, with or without a central
dot; two or many more concentric circles; a small circle with a central dot,
surrounded by a spiral line; the single spiral; the double spiral, or two spirals
starting from different centers; rows of small lozenges or ovals; stars of six to thirteen
rays; wheels of nine rays; flower ornaments, sometimes inclosed in a circle or
wide oval; wave-like lines; groups of lunette-shaped lines; pothooks; small squares
attached to each other side by side, so as to form a reticulated pattern; small attached
concentric circles; large and small hollows; a cup hollow surrounded by one or more
circles; lozenges crossed from angle to angle (these and the squares produced by scrapings);
an ornament like the spine of a fish with ribs attached, or the fiber system of
some leaf; short equiarmed crosses, starting sometimes from a dot and small circle; a
circle with rays round it, and the whole contained in a circle; a series of compressed
semicircles like the letters ∩ ∩ ∩ inverted; vertical lines far apart, with ribs sloping
downwards from them like twigs; an ornament like the fiber system of a broad leaf,
with the stem attached; rude concentric circles with short rays extending from part
of the outer one; an ornament very like the simple Greek fret, with dots in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172">[172]</a></span>
center of the loop; five zigzag lines and two parallel lines, on each of which, and
pointing toward each other, is a series of cones ornamented by lines radiating from
the apex, crossed by others parallel to the base&mdash;this design has been produced by
scraping, and I propose to call it the Patella ornament, as it strikingly resembles
the large species of that shell so common on our coasts, and which shell Mr. Conwell
discovered in numbers in some of the cists, in connection with fragments of pottery
and human bones; a semicircle with three or four straight lines proceeding from it,
but not touching it; a dot with several lines radiating from it; combinations of
short straight lines arranged either at right angles to or sloping from a central line;
an S-shaped curve, each loop inclosing concentric circles; and a vast number of
other combinations of the circle, spiral, line, and dot, which can not be described in
writing.</p></div>

<p>Some of the ancient “Turf-Monuments” of England are to be classed
as petroglyphs. The following extracts from the work of Rev. W. A.
Plenderleath (<i>b</i>) give sufficient information on these curious pictures:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although all the White Horses, except one, are in Wiltshire, that one exception
is the great sire and prototype of them all, which is at Uffington, just 2&frac12; miles outside
the Wiltshire Boundary and within that of Berkshire. * * * The one mediæval
document in which the White Horse is mentioned is a cartulary of the Abbey
of Abingdon, which must have been written either in the reign of Henry II or soon
after, and which runs as follows: “It was then customary amongst the English that
any monks who wished might receive money or landed estates and both use and devolve
them according to their pleasure. Hence two monks of the monastery at
Abingdon, named Leofric and Godric Cild, appear to have obtained by inheritance
manors situated upon the banks of the Thames; one of them, Godric, becoming possessed
of Spersholt, near the place commonly known as the White Horse Hill, and the
other that of Whitchurch, during the time that Aldhelm was abbot of this place.”</p>

<p>This Aldhelm appears to have been abbot from 1072 to 1084, and from the terms in
which the White Horse Hill is mentioned the name was evidently an old one at that
time.</p>

<p>Now it was only two hundred years before this time, viz, in 871, that a very
famous victory had been gained by King Alfred over the Danes close to this very
spot. “Four days after the battle of Reading,” says Asser, “King Æthelred, and
Alfred, his brother, fought against the whole army of the pagans at Ashdown. * * *
And the flower of the pagan youths were there slain, so that neither before nor since
was ever such destruction known since the Saxons first gained Britain by their arms.”
And it was in memory of this victory that, we are informed by local tradition, Alfred
caused his men, the day after the battle, to cut out the White Horse, the standard
of Hengist, on the hillside just under the castle. The name Hengist, or Hengst,
itself means <i>Stone Horse</i> in the ancient language of the Saxons, and Bishop Nicholson,
in his “English Atlas,” goes so far as to suppose the names of Hengist and
Horsa to have been not proper at all, but simply emblematical.</p>

<p>The Uffington horse measures 355 feet from the nose to the tail and 120 feet from
the ear to the hoof. It faces to sinister, as do also those depicted upon all British
coins. The slope of the portion of the hill upon which it is cut is 39°, but the
declivity is very considerably greater beneath the figures. The exposure is southwest.</p></div>

<p>The author then describes the White Horse on Bratton Hill, near
Westbury, Wilts, now obliterated, the dimensions of which were, extreme
length, 100 feet; height, nearly the same; from toe to chest, 54
feet, and gives accounts of several other White Horses, the antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173">[173]</a></span>
of which is not so well established. He then (<i>c</i>) treats of the Red
Horse in the lordship of Tysoe, in Warwickshire, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is traditionally reported to have been cut in 1461, in memory of the exploits
of Richard, Earl of Warwick, who was for many years one of the most prominent
figures in the Wars of the Roses. The earl had in the early part of the year found
himself, with a force of forty thousand men, opposed to Queen Margaret, with sixty
thousand, at a place called Towton, near Tadcaster. Overborne by numbers, the
battle was going against him, when, dismounting from his horse, he plunged his
sword up to the hilt in the animal’s side, crying aloud that he would henceforth
fight shoulder to shoulder with his men. Thereupon the soldiers, animated by their
leader’s example, rushed forward with such impetuosity that the enemy gave way
and flew precipitately. No less than twenty-eight thousand Lancastrians are said
to have fallen in this battle and in the pursuit which followed, for the commands of
Prince Edward were to give no quarter. It was to this victory that the latter owed
his elevation to the throne, which took place immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>The Red Horse used to be scoured every year, upon Palm Sunday, at the expense
of certain neighboring landowners who held their land by that tenure, and the
scouring is said to have been as largely attended and to have been the occasion of
as great festivity as that of the older horse in the adjoining county of Berks. The
figure is about 54 feet in extreme length by about 31 in extreme height.</p></div>

<p>The best known of Turf-Monuments other than horses is the Giant,
on Trendle Hill, near Cerne Abbas, in Dorsetshire. This the same
author (<i>d</i>) describes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a figure roughly representing a man, undraped, and with a club in his right
hand; the height is 180 feet, and the outlines are marked out by a trench 2 feet wide
and of about the same depth. It covers nearly an acre of ground. Hutchin imagines
this figure to represent the Saxon god, Heil, and places its date as anterior to A. D.
600. * * * Britton, on the other hand, tells us that “vulgar tradition makes
this figure commemorate the destruction of a giant who, having feasted on some
sheep in Blackmoor and laid himself to sleep on this hill, was pinioned down like
another Gulliver and killed by the enraged peasants, who immediately traced his
dimensions for the information of posterity.” There were formerly discernible some
markings between the legs of the figure rather above the level of the ankles, which
the country folk took for the numerals 748, and imagined to indicate the date. We
need, perhaps, scarcely remark that Arabic numerals were unknown in Europe until
at least six centuries later than this period.</p></div>


<h4>SWEDEN.</h4>

<p>Mr. Paul B. Du Chaillu (<i>a</i>) gives the following (condensed) account
describing, among many more “rock tracings,” as he calls them, those
reproduced as Figs. 137 and 138:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are found in Sweden large pictures engraved on the rocks which are of
great antiquity, long before the Roman period.</p>

<p>These are of different kinds and sizes, the most numerous being the drawings of
ships or boats, canoe-shaped and alike at both ends (with figures of men and animals),
and of fleets fighting against each other or making an attack upon the shore.
The hero of the fight, or the champion, is generally depicted as much larger than the
other combatants, who probably were of one people, though of different tribes, for
their arms are similar and all seem without clothing, though in some cases they are
represented as wearing a helmet or shield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>On some rocks are representations of cattle, horses, reindeer, turtles, ostriches,
and camels, the latter showing that in earlier times these people were acquainted
with more southern climes. The greatest number and the largest and most complicated
in detail of the tracings occur, especially in the present Sweden, in Bohuslän,
“the ancient Viken of the Sagas,” on the coast of the peninsula washed by the Cattegat.
They are also found in Norway, especially in Smaalenene, a province contiguous
to that of Bohuslän, but become more scarce in the north, though found on the
Trondhjem fjord.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">
<img src="images/dp233_pg174.png" width="414" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 137.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph in Bohuslän, Sweden.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 137 is a copy of a petroglyph in Tanum parish, Bohuslän, Sweden.
The large figure is doubtless a champion or commander, the exaggerated
size of which is to be noted in connection with that of the
Zulu chiefs in Fig. <a href="#page181">142</a>, infra, from South Africa, and Fig. <a href="#page652">1024</a>, infra,
from North America. There are numerous small holes and footprints
between the chief and the attacking force. Height, 20 feet; width, 15
feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Bohuslän the tracings are cut in the quartz, which is the geological formation
of the coast. They are mostly upon slightly inclined rocks, which are generally 200
or 300 feet or more above the present level of the sea, and which have been polished
by the action of the ice. The width of the lines in the same representation varies from
1 to 2 inches and even more, and their depth is often only a third or fourth of an
inch, and at times so shallow as to be barely perceptible. Those tracings, which
have for hundreds, perhaps for thousands, of years been laid bare to the ravages of
the northern climate, are now most difficult to decipher, while those which have
been protected by earth are as fresh as if they had been cut to-day. Many seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175">[175]</a></span>
have been cut near the middle or base of the hills, which were covered with vegetation,
and were in the course of time concealed by the detritus from above.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 138 is from the same author (<i>b</i>) and locality. Height, 29 feet;
width, 17 feet. The large birds and footprints and a chief designated
by his size will be noticed, and also a character in the middle of the
extreme upper part of the illustration which may be compared with
the largest human form in Fig. <a href="#page638">983</a>, infra, from Tule valley, California.</p>

<h4>FRANCE.</h4>

<p>Perrier du Carne (<i>a</i>), gives the following account (translated and condensed)
of signs carved on the dolmen of Trou-aux-Anglais, in Épone:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This dolmen, situated in the commune of Épone, in a place called Le Bois de la
Garenne, was constructed beneath the ground; it was concealed from view and it is
to this circumstance, no doubt, that its preservation is due. Nothing indicates that
it has been surmounted by a tumulus; in any case this tumulus had long since disappeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176">[176]</a></span>
and the ground was entirely leveled when the digging was commenced
some years ago. * * *</p>

<p>The characters (Fig. 139) are carved in intaglio on the farthest stone of the entrance,
on the left side. The whole of the inscription measures 1<sup>m</sup>, 10 in height
and 82 centimeters in width, and may be divided into two groups, an upper and a
lower one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/dp235_pg176.png" width="300" height="403" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 139.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph in
Épone, France.</div>
</div>

<p>The upper character represents a rectangular figure divided into three transverse
sections; in the third section and almost in the center is a cupule.</p>

<p>The lower character is more complicated and more difficult to describe. The first,
or left-hand portion, represents a stone hatchet with a shaft; there is no doubt as
to this, in my mind, as the outlines are perfectly clear, the design of the hatchet
being very distinct. This hatchet measures 0<sup>m</sup>, 108 in length and 38<sup>mm</sup> in width to the
edge of the blade. These are precisely the most common dimensions of the hatchets
of our country. As to the remainder of the character, I think an interpretation of
it difficult and premature.</p>

<p>On the whole, the result of an examination of these inscriptions leaves the impression
that the author did not seek to cover a stone with ornamentation, for these
outlines have nothing whatever of the ornamental, but that he wished to represent
to his people, by intelligible symbols, some particular idea.</p></div>

<p>É. Cartailhac (<i>a</i>) begins an account of petroglyphs
in the Department of Morbihan, in the old
province of Brittany, translated and condensed as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is hardly possible to give a description of the designs
in the covered way of Gavr’ inis. They are various linear
combinations, the lines being straight, curved, undulating,
isolated, or parallel, ramified like a fern, segments of concentric
circles, limited or not, and decorating certain compartments
with close winding spirals, recalling vividly the
figures produced by the lines on the skin in the hollow of
the hand and on the tips of the fingers.</p>

<p>In the midst of accumulated and very oddly grouped
lines, which no doubt are merely decorative, there are
found signs which must have had a meaning, and some figures easy to determine.</p>

<p>The hatchet, the stone hatchet and no other, the large hatchet of Tumiac, of
Mané-er-Hroèg, and of Mont Saint Michel, is represented in intaglio or in relief,
real size. A single pillar of Gavr’ inis bears eighteen of them. Less numerous
groups are seen on some other blocks of the same covered way.</p>

<p>On a little block placed under the ceiling in order to wedge up one of the covering
slabs, is seen the image of a hatchet with handle, conformable to a type found in the
marsh of Ehenside in Cumberland, England. On many other monuments the presence
of the same figures of hatchets, with handles or without, has been observed.
The most curious slab is certainly that of Mané-er-Hroèg. It had been broken, and
its three pieces had been thrown in disorder before the threshold of the crypt. One
of its faces, very well smoothed off, bears a cartouche in the form of a stirrup, filled
with enigmatic signs and surrounded above and below by a dozen hatchets with
handles, all engraved.</p>

<p>One other sign, the imprint of the naked foot, is to be noted, found only once on
this slab. Two human footprints are traced on one of the pillars of the crypt of the
Petit-Mont in Arzon. They are said to be divided off, by a slight relief, from
the rest of the granite frame on which they are sculptured, and which contains
other drawings. Similar figures, engraved on rock or on tombstones, are cited from
abroad, in lands far apart. In Sweden, the prints of naked or sandaled feet are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177">[177]</a></span>
common among the rock sculptures of the age of bronze which represent the curious
scenes of the life of the people of that period. It is proper to note that these Scandinavian
and Morbihan sculptures are not synchronous; the idea of an immediate influence
of one people on the other can not be entertained. One might, however,
maintain the identity of origin.</p>

<p>The other inscriptions of Brittany are enigmatic in every respect. But they
probably had a conventional value, a determined meaning. There is first of all a
sort of complicated cartouche, plainly defined, having the appearance of a buckler
or heraldic shield. Among the isolated signs it is proper to note a figure of the
shape of the letter U with the ends spread wide apart and curved in opposite directions.
It recalls, with some aid from the imagination, the character which on the
Scandinavian rocks represents more plainly ships and barks.</p></div>

<p>The sculpturing of hands and feet is to be remarked in connection
with similar characters on the rocks in America, many illustrations of
which appear in the present work.</p>

<p>B. Souché (<i>a</i>) in 1879 described and illustrated curious characters on
the walls of the crypt of the tumulus of Lisières (Deux-Sèvres), France,
some of which in execution markedly resemble several found in the
United States and figured in this work.</p>


<h4>SPAIN.</h4>

<p>Mr. T. Jagor (<i>a</i>) communicated a brochure in reference to the Cueva
de Altamira, transmitted to him by Prof. Vilanova in Madrid: “Short
notes on some prehistoric objects of the province of Santander,” in
which Don Marcelino de Sautuola describes the wall pictures and other
finds in the cave discovered by him at Altamira. Mr. Jagor remarks
as follows on the subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The reproductions of the large wall pictures discovered in that cave displayed, in
part, so excellent technique that the question arose how much of this excellence is
to be attributed to the prehistoric artist, and how much to his modern copyist. Mr.
Vilanova, who visited the cave soon after its discovery, and who regards the wall
pictures as prehistoric, being about equal in age to the Danish Kjökken-möddings,
states that the pictures given are pretty faithful imitations of the originals. The
published drawings are all found on the ceiling of the first cave; on the walls of the
subsequent caves are seen sketches of those pictures, which the artist afterwards
completed. The outlines of all the drawings have been cut in the wall with coarse
instruments, and nearly all the bone implements found in the cave show scratches,
which render it probable that they were used for this purpose. The colors used consist
merely of various kinds of ocher found in the province, without further preparation.
Finally Mr. Vilanova reports that in the cave farthest back there was found,
in his presence, an almost perfect specimen of <i>Ursus spelæus</i>.</p></div>

<p>Don Manuel de Góngora y Martinez (<i>a</i>) gives the account translated
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inscriptions of Fuencaliente are of great interest and importance. About one
league east of the town, on a spur of the Sierra de Quintana, at the site of the Piedra
Escritá, there is an almost inaccessible place, the home of wild beasts and mountain
goats. Beyond the river de los Batanes and the river de las Piedras, looking toward
sunset and toward the town, the artisans of a remote age cut skillfully and symmetrically
with the point of the pickax into the flank of the rock and of the
mountain, which is of fine flint, leaving a facade or frontispiece 6 yards in height<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178">[178]</a></span>
and twice as wide, and excavating there two contiguous caves, which are wide at
the mouth and end in a point, making two triangular niches polished on their four
faces. On the two outer fronts to the left and right appear more than 60 symbols or
hieroglyphs, written in a simple and rustic way with the index finger of a rude hand,
and with a reddish bituminous pigment. The niches, about a yard and a half in
height, 1 yard deep, and half a yard at the mouth, are covered by the exceedingly
hard and immense rock of the mountain. There is formed, as it were, a vestibule or
esplanade before the monument, and it is defended by a rampart made of the rocks
torn from the niches, strengthened with juniper, oaks, and cork trees. The half-moon,
the sun, an ax, a bow and arrows, an ear of corn, a heart, a tree, two human
figures, and a head with a crown stand out among those signs, the foreshadowings of
primitive writing.</p></div>

<p>The inscription on the first triangular face of the second cave is
reproduced here as the left-hand group of the upper part of Fig. <a href="#page689">1108</a>,
infra, and that “on the outer plane to the right, which already turns
pyramidally to the north,” is reproduced as the right-hand group of the
same figure. They are inserted at that place for convenient comparison
with other characters on the figure mentioned and with those in
Figs. <a href="#page683">1097</a> and <a href="#page689">1107</a>.</p>


<h4>ITALY.</h4>

<p>Mr. Moggridge (in Jour. Anthrop. Inst. Gr. Br. and I., <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span>, p. 65)
observes that one of the designs, <i>q</i>, reported by Dr. Von Haast from
New Zealand (see Fig. <a href="#page166">133</a>), was the same as one which had been seen on
rocks 6,900 feet above the sea in the northwest corner of Italy. He adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inscriptions are not in colors, as are those given in Dr. Von Haast’s paper, but
are made by the repeated dots of a sharp pointed instrument. It is probable that if
we knew how to read them they might convey important information, since the same
signs occur in different combinations, just as the letters of our alphabet recur in
different combinations to form words. Without the whole of these figures we can
not say whether the same probability applies to them.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 4.<br />

<span class="subhead">AFRICA.</span></h3>

<p>The following examples are selected from the large number of petroglyphs
known to have been discovered in Africa apart from those in
Egypt, which are more immediately connected with the first use of
syllabaries and alphabets, with symbolism and with gesture signs, under
which headings some examples of the Egyptian hieroglyphics appear
in this work.</p>


<h4>ALGERIA.</h4>

<p>In the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue Géographique Internationale</span> (<i>a</i>) is a communication
upon the rock inscriptions at Tyout (Fig. 140) and Moghar (Fig. 141)
translated, with some condensation, as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/dp238_pg179.jpg" class="hires" width="500" height="366" alt="" />
</a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 140.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs at Tyout, Algeria.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the last military expedition made in the Sahara Gen. Colonieu made a careful
restoration of the inscriptions on the rocks, whose existence was discovered at Tyout
and Moghar. At Tyout these inscriptions are engraved on red or Vosgian sandstone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179">[179]</a></span>
and at Moghar on a hard compact calcareous stone. At Moghar the designs are
more complicated than those at Tyout. An attempt has been made to render ideas
by more learned processes; to the simplicity of the line, the artlessness of the poses
which are seen at Tyout, there are added at Moghar academic attitudes difficult to
render, and which must be intended to represent some custom or ceremony in use
among the peoples who then inhabited this country. The costume at Moghar is also
more complicated. The ornaments of the head recall those of Indians, and the
woman’s dress is composed of a waist and a short skirt fastened by a girdle with
flowing ends. All this is very decent and elegant for the period. The infant at the
side is swaddled. The large crouching figure is the face view of a man who seems
to be bearing his wife on his shoulders. At the right of this group is a giraffe or
large antelope. In the composition above may be distinguished a solitary individual
in a crouching attitude, seen in front, the arms crossed in the attitude of
prayer or astonishment. The animals which figure in the designs at Moghar are
cattle and partridges. The little quadruped seated on its haunches may be a gerboise
(kind of rat), very common in these parts.</p>

<p>In the inscriptions at Tyout we easily recognize the elephant, long since extinct
in these regions, but neither horse nor camel is seen, probably not having been yet
imported into the Sahara country.</p></div>

<h4>EGYPT.</h4>

<p>While the picture-writings of Egypt are too voluminous for present
discussion and fortunately are thoroughly presented in accessible publications,
it seems necessary to mention the work of the late Mrs. A.
B. Edwards (<i>a</i>). She gives a good account of the petroglyphs on the
rocks bounding the ancient river bed of the Nile below Philæ, which
show their employment in a manner similar to that in parts of North
America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These inscriptions, together with others found in the adjacent quarries, range over
a period of between three and four thousand years, beginning with the early reigns<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180">[180]</a></span>
of the ancient empire and ending with the Ptolemies and Cæsars. Some are mere
autographs. Others run to a considerable length. Many are headed with figures of
gods and worshippers. These, however, are for the most part mere graffiti, ill
drawn and carelessly sculptured. The records they illustrate are chiefly votive.
The passer-by adores the gods of the cataract, implores their protection, registers
his name, and states the object of his journey. The votaries are of various ranks,
periods, and nationalities; but the formula in most instances is pretty much the
same. Now it is a citizen of Thebes performing the pilgrimage to Philæ, or a general
at the head of his troops returning from a foray in Ethiopia, or a tributary
prince doing homage to Rameses the Great and associating his suzerain with the
divinities of the place.</p></div>


<h4>SOUTH AFRICA.</h4>

<p>Dr. Richard Andree, in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeichen bei den Naturvölkern</span> (<i>a</i>), presents
well-considered remarks, thus translated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Hottentots and the Bantu peoples of South Africa produce no drawings,
though the latter accomplish something in indifferent sculptures. The draftsmen
and painters of South Africa are the Bushmen, who in this way, as well as by many
other striking ethnic traits, testify to their independent ethnic position. The extraordinary
multitude of figures of men and animals drawn by this people within
its whole area, now greatly reduced, from the cape at the south to the lands and
deserts north of the Orange river, and which they still draw at this day in gaudy
colors, testify to an uncommonly firm hand, a keenly observing eye, and a very
effective characterization. The Bushman artist mostly selects the surfaces of the
countless rock bowlders, the walls of caves, or rock walls protected by overhanging
crags, to serve as the canvas whereon to practice his art. He either painted his figures
with colors or chiseled them with a hard sharp stone on the rock wall, so that
they appear in intaglio. The number of these figures may be judged from the fact
that Fritsch at Hopetown found “thousands” of them, often twenty or more on one
block; Hubner, at “Gestoppte Fontein,” in Transvaal, saw two hundred to three
hundred together, carved in a soft slate. The earth colors employed are red, ochre,
white, black, mixed with fat or also with blood. What instrument (brush?) is employed
in applying the colors has not yet been ascertained, since, so far as I know,
no Bushman artist has yet been observed at his work. As regards the paintings<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181">[181]</a></span>
themselves, various classes may be distinguished, but in all cases the subjects are
representations of figures; ornaments and plants are excluded. First of all, there
are fights and hunting scenes, in which white men (boers) play a part, demonstrating
the modern origin of these paintings. Next there are representations of animals,
both of domestic animals (cattle, dogs) and of game, especially the various antelope
species, giraffes, ostriches, elephants, rhinoceroses, monkeys, etc. A special class
consists of representations of obscene nature, and, by way of exception, there has
been drawn in one instance a ship or a palm tree.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Emil Holub (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Bushmen, who are regarded as the lowest type of Africans, in one thing excel
all the other South African tribes whose acquaintance I made between the south
coast and 10° south latitude. They draw heads of gazelles, elephants, and hippopotami
astonishingly well. They sketch them in their caves and paint them with
ochre or chisel them out in rocks with stone implements, and on the tops of mountains
we may see representations of all the animals which have lived in those parts
in former times. In many spots where hippopotami are now unknown I found beautiful
sketches of these animals, and in some cases fights between other native races
and Bushmen are represented.</p></div>

<p>G. Weitzecker (<i>a</i>) gives a report of a large painting, in a cave at
Thaba Phatsoua district of Léribé, here presented as Fig. 142, containing
eighteen characters, with the addition of eight boys’ heads. It
represents the flight of Bushman women before some Zulu Kaffirs
(Matebele). The description, translated, is as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp241_pg182h.png">
<img src="images/dp241_pg182.png" class="hires" width="500" height="133" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 142.</span>&mdash;Petroglyph in Léribé, South Africa.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As usual, the Bushmen are represented as dwarfs and painted in bright color as
contrasted with the Kaffirs, who are painted large and of dark color. The scene is
full of life, a true artistic conception, and in the details there are many important
things to be noted. For this reason I add a sketch of it, with the figures numbered,
in order to be able to send you some brief annotations.</p>

<p>I will premise that as far as the women are concerned, in the small figures, no
mistaken notion should be entertained in regard to the anterior appendages which
catch, or rather strike, the eye in some of them. There is question simply of the pudendal
coverings of the Bushman women, consisting of a strip of skin, and flapping
in the wind.</p>

<p><i>a</i> seems to represent a woman in an advanced interesting condition, who in her
headlong flight has lost even her mantle. She holds in her hand a mogope (disproportionate);
that is to say, a gourd dipper, such as are found, I believe, among all
the south African tribes.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> This figure, besides the mogope which she holds in her left hand, carries away
in her flight, steadying it on her head with her right hand, a nkho (sesuto), a baked
earthenware vessel, in which drinks are kept, and of which the ethnographic museum
now contains some specimens. This woman, too, has lost all her clothing
except the pudendal covering, and she looks pregnant. The attitudes of flight,
while maintaining equilibrium, I deem very fine.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, and perhaps <i>j</i>. Women carrying their babies on their backs, as is
the practice of the natives, in the so-called thari; that is, a sheepskin so prepared
that they can fasten it to their bodies and hold it secure, even while bent to the
ground or running.</p>

<p><i>l</i> and <i>m</i>. Women with twins. It may be worthy of note that the painter has
placed them last, hampered as they are with a double weight.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Apparently a woman who has fallen in her flight. Figures <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> represent
men, who by their stature might be thought to be Bushmen, as also by their color,
which, so far as I remember, is not the same as that of the men coming up after
them, being rather similar to that of the women. In that case <i>e</i> would stoop to raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182">[182]</a></span>
the woman <i>c</i> who has fallen, and <i>i</i> would point the way to the others. Otherwise,
if there is question of Matebeles, which is rendered plausible by the fact that <i>n</i>
(which evidently represents an enemy) is not larger in stature than those two, then
<i>e</i> would stoop to snatch the baby of the fallen woman, and <i>i</i> would strive to catch
up with the two women <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>, who flee before it.</p>

<p><i>j.</i> I can not explain this unless as a diffusion of color, which has transformed into
something unrecognizable the figure of the child carried by its mother, who has
fallen, like <i>b</i>.</p>

<p><i>k</i> seems to be a woman resigned to her fate, who touches her neck with the left
hand, unless, indeed, the line which I take to be the arm is the sketch of the thari
with the baby.</p>

<p><i>l.</i> A woman who runs toward the looker-on.</p>

<p><i>m</i> represents a woman who has sat down, perhaps in order to place her twins
better in the thari, while behind her <i>n</i> arrives, preparing to spear her. With <i>n</i> the
band of enemies begins plainly, <i>o</i> seeming to be the leader, who, standing still, gives
the signal. But this figure must have been altered by the water, which by diluting
the color of the body has made it appear as a garment.</p>

<p><i>p</i> and <i>q</i>. These admirable portraits of impetuosity and menace are a pictorial
translation of the saying “having long legs so as to run fast.”</p>

<p><i>r.</i> A fine type of an attitude in the poise of running.</p></div>

<p>The author’s discussion respecting the difference in size between the
male human figures mentioned as indicating their respective tribes
would have been needless had he considered the frequent expedient of
representing chiefs or prominent warriors by figures of much larger
stature than that of common soldiers or subjects. This device is common
in the Egyptian glyphs, and examples of it also appear in the
present work. (See Figs. <a href="#page175">138</a>, <a href="#page176">139</a>, and <a href="#page652">1024</a>.)</p>

<p>The same author, loc. cit., gives a brief account of two petroglyphs
found by him near Leribo, in Basutoland, South Africa. They were
on a large hollow rock overlooking a plain where the bushmen might
spy game. The rock was all covered with pictures to a man’s height.
Many of them were entirely or almost entirely spoiled, both by the
hands of herdsmen and by water running down the walls in time of
rain. Some of them, however, are still very well preserved. They are
shown on Fig. 143.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 143.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in Basutoland, South Africa.</div>
</div>

<p>The left hand character represents a man milking an animal; the
latter, judging by the back part, especially by the legs, was at first
taken for an elephant; but the fore parts, especially the fore legs, evidently
are those of a bovine creature or of an elk (eland). The enormous
proportions of the back part are probably due to diffusion of colors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183">[183]</a></span>
through the action of water running down the rock. The right hand
character represents the sketch of an elk (eland), on which and under
which are depicted four monkeys, admirable for fidelity of expression.
The legs, with one exception, are not finished.</p>


<h4>CANARY ISLANDS.</h4>

<p>These islands are considered in connection with the continent of
Africa.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 144.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs in the Canary islands.</div>
</div>

<p>S. Berthelot (<i>a</i>) gives an account, referring to Figs. 144 and 145,
from which the following is extracted and translated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A site very little frequented, designated by the name of Los Letreros, appears to
have been inhabited in very ancient times by one of the aboriginal tribes established
on the Island of Fer, one of the Canary islands. At a distance of about three-quarters
of a league from the coast all the land sloping and broken by volcanic
mounds extends in undulations to the edge of the cliffs which flank the coast. It
is on this desert site, called Los Letreros, that inscriptions are found engraved on an
ancient flow of basaltic lava, with a smooth surface, over an extent of more than 400
meters. On all this surface, at various distances and without any relation to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184">[184]</a></span>
other, but placed where the lava presents the smoothest spots, rendered shining and
glassy by the light varnish left by the volcanic matter in
cooling, are the various groups of characters.</p>

<p>When we examine closely these different signs or characters
so deeply engraved [pecked] on the rock, doubtless
by means of some hard stone (obsidian or basalt), the first
thing observed is that several identical signs are reproduced
several times in the same group. These are, first,
round and oval characters, more or less perfect, sometimes
simple and isolated, again agglomerated in one group.
These characters so often reproduced are again seen in
juxtaposition or united, sometimes to others which are
similar, sometimes to different ones, and even inclosed in
others similar to them; for example, <i>a</i> in Fig. 144.</p>

<p>Round or more or less oval characters reappear several
times in <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Others, which are not met with more than once or twice
among the groups of signs, also present notable variations;
examples in <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>Of these are formed composite groups <i>d</i>, which belong,
however, to the system of round signs.</p>

<p>Other analogous but not identical signs appear to assume
rather the ovoid form than the round, and seem to have been
so traced as not to be confounded with the round symbols.
Some of them resemble leaves or fruit.</p>

<p>Another system of simple characters is the straight line,
which can be represented by a stroke of the pen, isolated
or repeated as if in numeration, and sometimes accompanied
by other signs.</p>

<p>Other peculiar signs shown in <i>e</i>, which are not repeated,
figure in the different groups of characters which the author
has reproduced.</p>

<p>We notice further, in <i>f</i>, a small number of signs which
bear a certain analogy to each other, and several of which
are accompanied by other and more simple characters.</p>

<p>Several others still more complicated are in eccentric
shapes which it is attempted to present in <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>Including the common oval characters often repeated and
those consisting of a simple stroke similar to the strokes
made by school children, all the various engraved characters
scarcely exceed 400.</p>

<p>Fig. 145 gives a view of a series of different groups of
signs in the length of the whole lava flow. The copyist
has expressed by dots those symbols which were confused,
partly defaced by the weather, or destroyed by fissures in
the rock.</p></div>

<p>The same author (<i>b</i>) gives an account of several
strange characters found engraved on a rock of
the grotto of Belmaco, in the island of La Palma,
one of the Canaries. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These drawings, presented that they may be compared
with those of Fer Island (Los Letreros), show some fifteen
signs, some of which are repeated several times and others partly effaced by weather,
or at least feebly traced. But what seems most remarkable is that six or seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185">[185]</a></span>
signs are recognized as exactly similar to those of Letreros, of the island of Fer,
and almost all the others are analogous, for we recognize at once in comparing them
the same style of bizarre writing, formed of hieroglyphic characters, mainly rude
arabesques.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 5.<br />

<span class="subhead">ASIA.</span></h3>

<p>A considerable number of petroglyphs found in Asia are described
and illustrated under other headings of this work. The following are
presented here for geographic grouping:</p>


<h4>CHINA.</h4>

<p>Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie (<i>c</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is apparently to the art of the aboriginal non-Chinese that the following inscription
[not copied] belongs, should it be proved to be primitive; and it is the only
precise mention I have ever found of the kind in my researches.</p>

<p>Outside of Li-tch’eng (in N. Shangtang), at some 500 li on the west towards the
north, is a stone cliff mountain, on the upper parts of which may be seen marks and
lines representing animals and horses. They are numerous and well drawn, like a
picture.</p></div>


<h4>JAPAN.</h4>

<p>Prof. Edward S. Morse (<i>a</i>) kindly furnishes the illustration, reduced
from a drawing made by a Japanese gentleman, Mr. Morishima, which
is here reproduced (1/30 original size) as Fig. 145 <i>a</i>:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp244_pg185h.png">
<img src="images/dp244_pg185.png" class="hires" width="500" height="165" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 145</span> <i>a</i>.&mdash;Petroglyph in Yezo, Japan.</div>
</div>

<p>Prof. Morse in a letter gives further information as follows:
“The inscriptions are cut in a rough way on the side of the cliff on the
northwestern side of the bay of Otaru. Otaru is a little town on the
western coast of Yezo. The cliffs are of soft, white tufa about 100 feet
high, and the inscriptions were cut possibly with stone axes, and were
1 inch in width and from &frac14; to &frac12; of an inch in depth. They are about 4
feet from the ground.”</p>

<p>Prof. John Milne (<i>a</i>) remarks upon the same petroglyph, of which he
gives a rude copy, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So far as I could learn the Japanese are quite unable to recognize any of the characters,
and they regard them as being the work of the Ainos.</p>

<p>I may remark that several of the characters are like the runic <i>m</i>. It has been suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186">[186]</a></span>
that they have a resemblance to old Chinese. A second suggestion was that
they might be drawings of the insignia of rank carried by certain priests; a third
idea was that they were phallic; a fourth that they were rough representations of
men and animals, the runic m being a bird; and a fifth that they were the handicraft
of some gentleman desirous of imposing upon the credulity of wandering
archæologists.</p>

<p>I myself am inclined to think that they were the work of the peoples who have
left so many traces of themselves in the shape of kitchen middens and various implements
in this locality. In this case they may be Aino.</p></div>

<p>Another illustration from Japan is presented in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page734">LII</a></span>.</p>


<h4>INDIA.</h4>

<p>Mr. Rivett-Carnac, in Archæologic Notes on Ancient Sculpturings on
Rocks in Kumaon, India (<i>a</i>), gives a description of the glyphs copied in
Fig. 146:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">
<a href="images/dp246_pg187h.jpg">
<img src="images/dp246_pg187.jpg" class="hires" width="353" height="500" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 146.</span>&mdash;Petroglyphs at Chandeshwar, India.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At a point about two miles and a half south of Dwara-Hath, and twelve miles
north of the military station of Ranikhet in Kumaon, the bridle-road leading from
the plains through Naini Tal and Ranikhet to Baijnath, and thence on to the celebrated
shrine of Bidranath, is carried through a narrow gorge at the mouth of which
is a temple sacred to Mahadeo, ... which is locally known by the name of
Chandeshwar.</p>

<p>About two hundred yards south of the temple, toward the middle of the defile,
rises a rock at an angle of forty-five degrees presenting a surface upon which, in a
space measuring fourteen feet in height by twelve in breadth, more than two hundred
cups are sculptured. They vary from an inch and a half to six inches in diameter
and from half an inch to an inch in depth, and are arranged in groups composed
of approximately parallel rows.</p></div>

<p>The cups are mostly of the simple types and only exceptionally surrounded
by single rings or connected by grooves.</p>


<h4>SIBERIA.</h4>

<p>N. S. Shtukin (<i>a</i>) referring to certain picture-writings on the cliffs of
the Yenesei river, in the Quarterly Isvestia of the Imperial Geographical
Society for 1882, says: “These are figured, but are not particularly
remarkable, except as being the work of invaders from the far south,
perhaps Persians. Camels and pheasants are among the animals represented.”</p>

<p>Philip John von Strahlenberg, in An Historico-Geographical Description
of the North and Eastern Parts of Europe and Asia, etc., reported
inscriptions relating to the chase, on the banks of the river Yenesei.
He says of one: “It takes its characteristic features from the natural
history of the region; and we may suppose it to embrace rude representations
of the Siberian hare, the cabarda or musk deer and other
known quadrupeds.”</p>

<p>He also furnishes a transcript of inscriptions found by him on a precipitous
rock on the river Irtish. This rock, which is 36 feet high, is
isolated. It has four sides, one of which faces the water and has a
number of tombs or sepulchral caves beneath. All of the four faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187">[187]</a></span>
have rude representations of the human form, and other unintelligible
characters are drawn in red colors in a durable kind of pigment, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188">[188]</a></span>
is found to be almost indestructible and is much used for rock inscriptions.</p>

<p>Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie, op. cit., makes the following remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Symbolical marks, incised or drawn graffitti, not properly speaking inscriptions,
have been found in Siberia, but they are not the expected primitive remains of ancient
writings. Some are purely Tartar, being written in Mongolian and Kalmuck; others,
obviously the work of common people, may be Arabic, while some others found on
the left bank of the Jenissei river are much more interesting. They seem to me to
be badly written in Syriac, from right to left horizontally, before the time of the
adaptation of this writing to the Uigur and Mongol. The characters are still separated
one from the other. On one of these graffitti found at the same place several Chinese
characters, as written by common people, are recognizable.</p>

<p>Some hieroglyphical graffitti have been discovered on rocks above Tomsk, on the
right bank of the Tom river, in Siberia. They are incised at a height of more than
20 feet. They are very rude, and somewhat like the famous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Livre de Sauvages</span> of
merry fame in palæography. Quadrupeds, men, heads, all roughly drawn, and some
indistinct lines, are all that can be seen. It looks more like the pictorial figures
which can be used as a means of notation by ignorant people at any moment than
like an historical beginning of some writing. There is not the slightest appearance
of any sort of regularity or conventional arrangement in them.</p>

<p>The last we have to speak of are quite peculiar and altogether different from the
others. The signs are painted in red. They are made of straight lines, disposed like
drawings of lattices and window shades, and also like the tree characters of the
Arabs and like the runes. They are met with near the Irtisch river, on a rock over
the stream Smolank.</p></div>

<p>Figs. <a href="#page387">513</a>, <a href="#page514">721</a>, <a href="#page515">722</a>, and <a href="#page517">723</a>, infra, have relation to this geographic
region.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that some of the Siberian and Tartar characters,
especially those reproduced by Schoolcraft, I, Pls. 65 and 66, have a
strong resemblance to the drawings of the Ojibwa, some of which are
figured and described in the present work, and this coincidence is more
suggestive from the reason that the totem or dodaim, which often is
the subject of those drawings, is a designation which is used by both
the Ojibwa and the Tartar with substantially the same sound and significance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="subhead">CUP SCULPTURES</span></h2>


<p>The simplest form of rock inscription is almost ubiquitous. In Europe,
Asia, Africa, America, and Oceanica, shallow, round, cup-like
depressions are found, sometimes in rows, sometimes singly, sometimes
surrounded by a ring or rings, but often quite plain. The cup-markers
often arranged their sculpturings in regularly spaced rows, not infrequently
surrounding them with one or more clearly cut rings; sometimes,
again, they associated them with concentric circles or spirals.
Occasionally the sculptors demonstrated the artificial character of their
work by carving it in spots beyond the reach of atmospheric influences,
such as the interiors of stone cists or of dwellings. It must, however,
be noted that, although there is thus established a distinction between
those markings which are natural and those which are artificial, it is
possible that there may have been some distant connection between the
two, and that the depressions worn by wind and rain may have suggested
the idea of the devices, now called cup-markings, to those who
first sculptured them.</p>

<p>Vast numbers of these cup stones are found in the British islands,
often connected with other petroglyphs. In the county of Northumberland
alone there are 53 stones charged with 350 sculptures, among
which are many cup depressions. So also in Germany, France, Denmark,
and indeed everywhere in Europe, but these forms took their
greatest development in India.</p>

<p>The leading work relating to this kind of sculpture is that of Prof.
J. Y. Simpson (<i>a</i>), afterward known as Sir James Simpson, who reduces
the forms of the cup sculptures to seven elementary types, here reproduced
in Fig. 147. His classification is as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<a href="images/dp249_pg190h.png">
<img src="images/dp249_pg190.png" class="hires" width="325" height="500" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 147.</span>&mdash;Types of cup sculptures.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First type. <i>Single cups.</i>&mdash;They are the simplest type of these ancient stone-cuttings.
Their diameter varies from 1 inch to 3 inches and more, while they are often
only half an inch deep, but rarely deeper than an inch or an inch and a half.
They commonly appear in different sizes on the same stone or rock, and although
they sometimes form the only sculptures on a surface they are more frequently associated
with figures of a different character. They are in general scattered without
order over the surface, but occasionally four or five or more of them are placed in
more or less regular groups, exhibiting a constellation-like arrangement.</p>

<p>Second type. <i>Cups surrounded by a single ring.</i>&mdash;The incised rings are usually much
shallower than the cups and mostly surround cups of comparatively large size. The
ring is either complete or broken, and in the latter case it is often traversed by a
radial groove which runs from the central cup through and even beyond the ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Third type. <i>Cups surrounded by a series of concentric complete rings.</i>&mdash;In this complete
annular form the central cup is generally more deeply cut than the surrounding
rings, but not always.</p>

<p>Fourth type. <i>Cups surrounded by a series of concentric, but incomplete rings having a
straight radial groove.</i>&mdash;This type constitutes perhaps the most common form of the
circular carvings. The rings generally touch the radial line at both extremities,
but sometimes they terminate on each side of it without touching it. The radial
groove occasionally extends considerably beyond the outer circle, and in most cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191">[191]</a></span>
it runs in a more or less downward direction on the stone or rock. Sometimes it
runs on and unites into a common line with other ducts or grooves coming from
other circles, till thus several series of concentric rings are conjoined into a larger
or smaller cluster, united together by the extension of their radial branch-like
grooves.</p>

<p>Fifth type. <i>Cups surrounded by concentric rings and flexed lines.</i>&mdash;The number of inclosing
or concentric rings is generally fewer in this type than in the two last preceding
types, and seldom exceeds two or three in number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Sixth type. <i>Concentric rings without a central cup.</i>&mdash;In many cases the concentric
rings of the types already described appear without a central cup or depression,
which is most frequently wanting in the complete concentric circles of the third
type.</p>

<p>Seventh type. <i>Concentric circular lines of the form of a spiral or volute.</i>&mdash;The central
beginning of the spiral line is usually, but not always, marked by a cup-like excavation.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>It often occurs that two, three, or more of these various types are
found on the same stone or rock, a fact indicating that they are intimately
allied to each other.</p>

<p>Prof. Simpson presents what he calls “the chief deviations from the
principal types” reproduced here as Fig. 148.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 148.</span>&mdash;Variants of cup sculptures.</div>
</div>

<p>The first four designs represent cups connected by grooves, which is
a noticeable and frequently occurring feature. In Fig. 149 views of
sculptured rock surfaces at Auchnabreach, Argyleshire, Scotland, are
given. Simple cups, cups surrounded
by one ring or by concentric
rings, with radial grooves
and spirals, appear here promiscuously
mingled. Fig. 150 exhibits
isolated as well as connected cups,
a cup surrounded by a ring, and
concentric rings with radial
grooves, on a standing stone (menhir),
belonging to a group of seven
at Ballymenach, in the parish of
Kilmichael-Glassary, in Argyleshire,
Scotland.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Berthold Seeman remarks
concerning the characters in Fig.
<a href="#page144">105</a>, supra, copied from a rock in
Chiriqui, Panama, that he discovers
in it a great resemblance to
those of Northumberland, Scotland,
and other parts of Great
Britain. He says, as quoted by
Dr. Rau (<i>d</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is singular that, thousands of miles away, in a remote corner of tropical America,
we should find the concentric rings and several other characters typically identical
with those engraved on the British rocks.</p>

<p>The characters in Chiriqui are, like those of Great Britain, incised on large stones,
the surface of which has not previously undergone any smoothing process. The incised
stones occur in a district of Veraguas (Chiriqui or Alanje), which is now thinly
inhabited, but which, judging from the numerous tombs, was once densely peopled.</p>

<p>From information received during my two visits to Chiriqui and from what has
been published since I first drew attention to this subject, I am led to believe that
there are a great many inscribed rocks in that district. But I myself have seen
only one, the now famous <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">piedra pintal</i> (i. e., painted stone), which is found on a
plain at Caldera, a few leagues from the town of David. It is 15 feet high, nearly 50
feet in circumference, and rather flat on the top. Every part, especially the eastern
side, is covered with incised characters about an inch or half an inch deep. The
first figure on the left hand side represents a radiant sun, followed by a series of
heads or what appear to be heads, all with some variation. It is these heads, particularly
the appendages (perhaps intended for hair?), which show a certain resemblance
to one of the most curious characters found on the British rocks, and calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194">[194]</a></span>
to mind the so-called “Ogham characters.” These “heads” are succeeded by scorpion-like
or branched and other fantastic figures. The top of the stone and the other
sides are covered with a great number of concentric rings and ovals, crossed by
lines. It is especially these which bear so striking a resemblance to the Northumbrian
characters.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 151.</span>&mdash;Cup sculptures in Chiriqui.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 151 presents five selected characters from the rock mentioned:
<i>a</i> attached to the respective numbers always refers to the Chiriqui and
<i>b</i> to the British type of the several designs; 1<i>a</i> and 1<i>b</i> represent radiant
suns; 2<i>a</i> and 2<i>b</i> show several grooves, radiating from an outer arch,
resembling, as Dr. Seeman thinks, the Ogham characters; 3<i>a</i> and 3<i>b</i>
show the completely closed concentric circles; 4<i>a</i> and 4<i>b</i> show how the
various characters are connected by lines; 5<i>a</i> and 5<i>b</i> exhibit the groove
or outlet of the circle.</p>

<p>Mr. G. H. Kinahan, in Journal of the Anthropological Institute of
Great Britain and Ireland, 1889, p. 171, gives an account of Barnes’s
Inscribed Dallâus, County Donegal, Ireland. One of his figures bears
four cups joined together by lines forming a cross. The remainder of
the illustrations consist of concentric rings and cups resembling others
already figured in this paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Marcano (<i>c</i>) describes Fig. 152 as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The chain of Cuchivero, situated in Venezuela between the Orinoco and the Caura,
shows on its flanks small plateaus on which are numerous stones which seem to have
been aligned. This chain is separated by a deep valley from that of Tiramuto, from
which were copied the petroglyphs here presented. The one represents a single sun,
the other two suns joined together. The rays of the former run from one circumference
to the other. The other two are joined together by a central stroke, and the
rays all start from the outer circumference.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 152.</span>&mdash;Cup sculptures in Venezuela.</div>
</div>

<p>The same author (loc. cit.) thus describes Fig. 153:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These designs, taken on the little hills of the high Cuchivero, differ altogether
from the preceding. <i>a</i> is a very regular horizontal grouping. It begins by a spiral
joined to three figures similar among themselves, and similar also to the eyes of
jaguars which we have often met with. There follows a sort of isolated fret; at
its right is another, larger and joined to a circle different from the
preceding; it has a central point, and the second circumference is
interrupted. The figure terminates in a spiral like the one at the
beginning of the line, and which, being turned in the opposite
direction, serves as its pendant.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 153.</span>&mdash;Cup sculptures in Venezuela.</div>
</div>

<p><i>b</i> is formed of two horizontal rows one above the other. We
there find first of all two frets united by a vertical stroke ending in
a hook. The characters which follow, resembling those of <i>a</i>, are
distinct in each row, but on closer inspection they are seen to
have a peculiar correspondence.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Ladisláu Netto (<i>b</i>) gives copies of carvings on the
rocks in Brazil on the banks of the Rio Negro, from
Moura to the city of Manaus, and remarks upon the characters reproduced
here as Fig. 154, that they represent the figure of the multiple
concentric circles joined together two by two, as were found<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196">[196]</a></span>
on several other rocks in the same region, and as they appear in
many inscriptions of Central America and at various points of North
America.</p>

</div>

<p>Senhor Araripe (<i>b</i>) gives the following account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Banabuiu, Brazil, about three-quarters of a league from the plantation of Caza-nova,
on the road to Castelo, is a stone resting upon another, at the height of a man,
which the inhabitants call <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Pedra-furada</span> (pierced stone) having on its western face
the inscription in Fig. 155.</p>

<p>The characters have been much effaced by the rubbing of cattle against them;
the stone has also cracked. Some fragments lying at the foot of it bear on their
upper faces round holes made by a sharp tool, and resembling those shown in this
figure.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 155.</span>&mdash;Cup sculptures in Brazil.</div>
</div>

<p>Cup stones, called by the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pierres à ecuelles</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pierres à
cupules</i> and by the Germans <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schalensteine</i>, are found throughout Hindustan,
on the banks of the Indus, at the foot of the Himalayas, in
the valley of Cashmere, and on the many cromlechs around Nagpoor.
At this very day one may see the Hindu women carrying the water of
the Ganges all the way to the mountains of the Punjab, to pour into
the cupules and thus obtain from the divinity the boon of motherhood
earnestly desired.</p>

<p>The cup sculptures often become imposing by their number and combination.
In the Kamaon mountains there are numerous blocks that
support small basins. One of them is mentioned as being 13 feet in
length by 9 in breadth and 7 in height, and showing five rows of cupules.
At Chandeswar (see Fig. <a href="#page186">146</a>) the rocks themselves are covered with
these signs. They present two different types. One of the most frequent
groups shows a simple round cavity; in the others, the cupels
are encircled by a sort of ring carved in intaglio and encircling figures.
One of these figures recalls the swastika, the sacred sign of the Aryans.
The present Hindus are absolutely ignorant of the origin of these sculptures;
they are fain to attribute them to the Goalas, a mysterious race
of shepherd kings who preceded the great invasions which imprinted
an indelible stamp on the Indies as well as on Europe. These cupels
are correlated with the worship of Mahadeo, one of the many names
given to Siva, the third god of the Hindu triad, whose emblem is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197">[197]</a></span>
serpent. Chandeswar is reached through a narrow gorge; at the entrance
is found a temple sacred to Mahadeo. The columns and slabs
bear cupules similar to those seen on the rocks.</p>

<p>Some of the Mahadeo designs
engraved on stone slabs in this
temple (see Rivett-Carnac, loc. cit.)
are represented in Fig. 156, showing
a marked resemblance to and
approaching identity with this class
of cuttings on bowlders, rocks, and
megalithic monuments in Europe.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 156.</span>&mdash;Cup sculptures in India.</div>
</div>

<p>A large number of stones with
typical cup markings have been
found in the United States of
America. Some of those illustrated
in this paper are presented in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page058">V</a></span>,
and Figs. <a href="#page061">19</a> and <a href="#page086">48</a>.</p>

<p>Among the many attempts, all
hitherto unsatisfactory, to explain
the significance of the cup stones
as distributed over nearly all parts
of the earth, one statement of Mr.
Rivett-Carnac (<i>b</i>) is of value as
furnishing the meaning now attached
to them in India. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Having seen sketches and notes on
rock sculptures in India which closely
resemble unexplained rock carvings in
Scotland, and having myself found one
of the Scotch forms cut on a bowlder in
Kángrá, * * * being at Ayodhyá
with a Hindu who speaks good English,
I got a fakir and drew on the sand of the
Gogra the figure
<img src="images/dp256_pg197a.png" class="inline_image" width="30" height="29" alt="concentric circles" />
. I asked what
that meant. The fakir at once answered,
“Mahadeo.” I then drew
<img src="images/dp256_pg197b.png" class="inline_image" width="30" height="32" alt="concentric circles with line from center" />
 and got
the same answer. At Delhi my old
acquaintance, Mr. Shaw, told me that
these two signs are chalked on stones
in Kángrá by people marching in marriage
processions. The meaning given to these
two symbols now in India is familiarly
known to the people.</p></div>

<p>Mahadeo, more accurately Mahadiva, is the god of generation. He
is worshiped by the Sawas, one of the numerous Hindu sects, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198">[198]</a></span>
form of a phallus, often represented by a simple column, which sometimes
is placed on the yoni or female organ. It is suggested that in a
common form of the sculptures the inner circle represents the Mahadeo
or lingam, and the outer or containing circle the yoni. No idea of
obscenity occurs from this representation to the Hindus, who adore
under this form the generative power in nature.</p>

<p>Prof. Douglas, in the Saturday Review, November 24, 1883, furnishes
some remarks on the topic now considered:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Palestine and the country beyond Jordan some of the marks found are so large
that it has been supposed that they may have been used as small presses of wine, or
as mortars for pounding the gleanings of wheat. But there is an objection to these
theories as accounting for the marks generally, which is fatal to them. To serve
these purposes the rocks on which the marks occur should be in a horizontal position,
whereas in a majority of cases all over the world the “cups” are found either
on shelving rocks or on the sides of perpendicular stones. This renders worthless
also the ideas which have at different times been put forward that they may have
been used for some sort of gambling game, or as sun-dials. A Swiss archæologist
who has lately devoted himself to the question believes that he has recognized, in
the sculpturings under his observation, maps of the surrounding districts, the
“cups” indicating the mountain peaks. In the same way others have thought that
similar markings may have been intended as maps or plans pointing out the direction
and character of old circular camps and cities in their neighborhood. But if
any such resemblances have been discovered they can hardly be other than fortuitous,
since it is difficult to understand how rows of cup marks, arranged at regular
intervals and in large numbers, could have served as representatives either of the
natural features of a country or of camps and cities. But a closer resemblance may
be found in them as maps if we suppose that they were intended to represent things
in the heavens rather than on earth. The round cup-like marks are reasonably suggestive
of the sun, moon, and stars, and if only an occasional figure could be found
representing a constellation, some color might be held to be given to the idea; but
unfortunately this is not the case. Nevertheless the shape of the marks has led
many to believe that they are relics of the ancient sun worship of Phœnicia, and
that their existence in Europe is due to the desire of the Phœnician colonists to convert
our forefathers to their faith. But there are many reasons for regarding this
theory, though supported by the authority of Prof. Nilsson, as untenable. The
observations of late years have brought to light cup marks and megalithic circles in
parts of Europe on which a Phœnician foot never trod; and it is a curious circumstance
that in those portions of the British Isles most frequented by these indefatigable
traders there are fewer traces of these monuments than in the northern and
inland districts, which were comparatively inaccessible to them.</p></div>

<p>The Swiss archæologist mentioned above by Prof. Douglas is Fritz
Roediger (<i>a</i>), of whose theory the following is a translated abstract:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What renders the deciphering of these sign stones exceedingly difficult (I purposely
avoid the words “map stones” because not all are such) is their great variety in
size, position, material, workmanship, and meaning. I will here speak of the latter
only, inasmuch as there are stones which in their smallest and their largest form
are yet frequently nothing else than boundary stones, whose origin can often not be
definitely established as prehistoric, while on the other hand again we discover
well-marked boundary stones, which at the same time show the outline of the piece
of ground which they guard. Similarly we find prehistoric (Gallic) “Leuk” stones,
differing from the meter-high communal and state boundary stones of modern times
in nothing but this, that they have some indistinct grooves and one or two hooks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199">[199]</a></span>
while on the other hand we meet “Leuk” stones, which on their restricted heads,
often also on the side walls, indicate their environs for (Leuk) miles around, up,
down, and sidewise, while a third class of this form merely adorn crossroads, and
indicate deviations by means of lines and points (waranden). Thus we find quite
extensive slabs or structures that signify only some hectares, often only one, while
we meet very small ones, or, at any rate, of moderate size, which, one man can move,
that represent very large districts, some presenting only lines and grooves, others
with shells of various sizes, a third kind with both kinds of ornaments and samples
of ornaments, and again others with no sign at all, but yet respected as stones of
special meaning by the population, and called “hot stone,” “pointed stone,”
“heath stone,” “child’s stone,” etc. Other stones have basin-like or platter-like
depressions, and finally there are outcropping rocks with marks of one kind or
another, holes, rents, clefts, etc. A further great difficulty hampering the deciphering
of these wonderful stones is the lack of opportunities for comparison and experience.
I have been markedly favored in this respect by my sojourn and wanderings in
valley, mountain and alp. Western Switzerland is a very paradise for investigations
of this kind, especially the lake country and the upper part of the canton of
Solothurn (Soleure). A third difficulty, often insuperable, lies in the nonexistence
of appropriate good maps for comparison. In this respect too we are well off
in Switzerland.</p>

<p>According to my observations in this field, now continued nearly 12 years, prehistoric
man had: (1) His land or province survey; (2) his circle, district, and communal
surveys, in reference to which (3) the Alpine surveys deserve special mention,
in cantons which down to the present day know nothing of such surveys; (4) private
and special surveys. Thus it seems that my observations lend full confirmation to
the oldest historic or traditional statements concerning the tenure of land of the
Kelto-Germans or Germano-Kelts.</p></div>

<p>Among the Ojibwa concentric circles, according to Schoolcraft (<i>d</i>),
constituted the symbol of time. It would be dangerous to explain the
many markings of this character by the suggested symbolism, which
also recalls that of Egypt in relation to the circle-figure. Inquiries
have often been made whether the North American Indians have any
superstitious or religious practices connected with the markings under
consideration, e. g., in relation to the desire for offspring, which undoubtedly
is connected with the sculpturing of cup depressions and
furrows in the eastern hemisphere. No evidence is yet produced of
any such correspondence of practice or tradition relating to it. In the
absence of any extrinsic explanation the prosaic and disappointing
suggestion intrudes that circular concentric rings are easy to draw and
that the act of drawing them suggests the accentuation of depressions or
hollows within their curves. Much stress is laid upon the fact that the
characters are found in so many parts of the earth, with the implication
that all the sculptors used them with the same significance, thus
affording ground for the hypothesis that anciently one race of people
penetrated all the regions designated. But in such an implication the
history of the character formed by two intersecting straight lines is
forgotten. The cross is as common as the cup-stone, and has, or anciently
had, a different signification among the different people who
used it, beginning as a mark and ending as a symbol. Therefore, it
may readily be imagined that the rings in question, which are drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200">[200]</a></span>
nearly as easily as the cross, were at one time favorite but probably
meaningless designs, perhaps, in popular expression, “instinctive” commencements
of the artistic practice, as was the earliest delineation of
the cross-figure. Afterward the rings, if employed as symbols or emblems,
would naturally have a different meaning applied to them in
each region where they now appear.</p>

<p>It must, however, be noted that the figures under discussion can be
and often are the result of conventionalization. A striking remark is
made by Mr. John Murdoch (<i>a</i>), of the Smithsonian Institution, that
south of Bering strait the design of the “circle and dot,” which may be
regarded as the root of the cup sculpture, is the conventionalized representation
of a flower, and is very frequently seen as an ornamental
device.</p>

<p>An elucidation of some of the most common forms of cup sculptures
is given, without qualification and also without authority, but with the
serene consciousness of certainty, by the Rev. Charles Rogers, “<span class="smcap lowercase">D.D.</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">LL. D.</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">F. S. A.</span>, Scot., etc.,” as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sculptures are sacred books, which the awe-inspired worshipper was required
to revere and, probably, to salute with reverence. A single circle represented the
sun, two circles in union the sun and moon&mdash;Baal and Ashtaroth. The wavy groove
passing across the circle pointed to the course of water from the clouds, as discharged
upon the earth. Groups of pit marks pointed to the stars or, more probably, to the
oaks of the primeval temples.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="subhead">PICTOGRAPHS GENERALLY.</span></h2>


<p>In leaving the geographic distribution of petroglyphs to examine
the comprehensive theme of pictographs in general, the first and correct
impression is that the mist of the archaic and unknown is also left and
that the glow of current significance is reached. The pictographs of
the American Indians are seldom if ever cryptographs, though very
often conventional and sometimes, for special reasons, preconcerted,
as are their signals. They are intended to be understood without a
key, and nearly all of those illustrated below in the present work are
accompanied by an interpretation. As the art is in actual daily use it
is free from the superstition pending from remote antiquity.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that a large proportion of the pictographs to be now
presented, which are not petroglyphs, are Micmac, Abnaki, Dakota, and
Ojibwa, although it is admitted that as many more could be obtained
from other tribes, such as the Zuñi and the Navajo. The reason for the
omission of details regarding the latter is that they are already published,
or are in the course of publication, by Mrs. Stevenson, Dr.
Matthews, Mr. Cushing, Mr. Fewkes, and other writers, who have
specially devoted themselves to the peoples mentioned and the region
occupied by them.</p>

<p>The present writer obtained a valuable collection of birch-bark pictographs
immemorially and still made by the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot
tribes of Abnaki in Maine, showing a similarity in the use of
picture-writing between the members of the widespread Algonquian
stock in the regions west of the great lakes and those on the northeastern
seaboard. He also learned that the same art was common to
the less known Montagnais and Nascapees in the wooded regions north
of the St. Lawrence. This correlation of the pictographic practice, in
manner and extent, was before inferentially asserted, but no satisfactory
evidence of it had been furnished until the researches of the Bureau
of Ethnology, in 1887 and 1888, made by the writer, brought into direct
comparison the pictography of the Ojibwa with that of the Micmacs
and the Abnaki. Many of the Indians of the last-named tribes still use
marks and devices on birch bark in the ordinary affairs of life, especially
as notices of departure and direction and for warning and guidance.
The religious use of original drawings among them, which is still prominent
among the Ojibwa, has almost ceased, but traces of it remain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The most interesting of all the accounts regarding the pictographs
of the North American Indians published before the last decade was
contained in the works of Henry R. Schoolcraft, issued in 1853 and
subsequent years, and the most frequently quoted part of his contributions
on this subject describes the pictographs of the Ojibwa. He
had special facilities for obtaining accurate information with regard to
all matters relating to that tribe on account of his marriage to one of
its women, a granddaughter of a celebrated chief, Waub-o-jeeg and
daughter of a European named Johnson. She was educated in Ireland
and had sufficient intelligence to understand and describe to her husband
the points of interest relating to her tribe.</p>

<p>The accounts given by Mr. Schoolcraft, with numerous illustrations,
convey the impression that the Ojibwa were nearly as far advanced in
hieroglyphic writing as the Egyptians before their pictorial representations
had become syllabic. The general character of his voluminous
publications has not been such as to assure modern critics of
his accuracy, and the wonderful combination of minuteness and comprehensiveness
attributed by him to the Ojibwa “hieroglyphs” has of late
been generally regarded with suspicion. It was considered in the
Bureau of Ethnology an important duty to ascertain how much of truth
existed in these remarkable accounts, and for that purpose the writer,
with Dr. Hoffman as assistant, examined the most favorable points in
the present habitat of the tribe, namely, the northern regions of Minnesota
and Wisconsin, to ascertain how much was yet to be discovered.</p>

<p>The general results of the comparison of Schoolcraft’s statements
with what is now found show that he told the truth in substance, but
with much exaggeration and coloring. The word “coloring” is particularly
appropriate, because in his copious illustrations various colors
were used freely and with apparent significance, whereas, in fact, the
general rule in regard to the birch-bark rolls was that they were never
colored at all; indeed, the bark was not adapted to coloration. The
metaphorical coloring was also flourished by him in a manner which
seems absurd to any thorough student of the Indian philosophy and
religions. Metaphysical concepts are attached by him to some of the
devices which he calls “symbols,” which could never have been entertained
by a people in the stage of culture of the Ojibwa. While some
symbolism, in the wide sense of the term, may be perceived, iconography
and ideography are more apparent.</p>

<p>The largest part of the bark rolls and other pictographs of the Ojibwa
obtained by the Bureau, relates to the ceremonies of the Midē' and of
the shamanistic orders; another division refers to the Jessakid performances,
which can be classed under the head of jugglery; and a third
part embraces the more current and practical uses. Examples of all of
these are given, infra.</p>

<p>The difficulties sometimes attending the pursuit of ceremonial pictographs
were exemplified to the writer at Odanah, Wisconsin. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203">[203]</a></span>
few of the Ojibwa in that neighborhood, who are generally civilized
and in easy circumstances, had any more than a vague knowledge that
such things as inscribed bark rolls had ever existed. Three, however,
were traced and one was shown. The owner, an uncompromising heathen,
was called Kitche-sha-bads. “Kitche” means big, “sha” is an
attempt at the French form of John, and “bads” is a bad shot at Baptiste,
the whole translation, therefore, being “Big John the Baptist.”
This old fellow, though by no means as enterprising or successful as
some of the younger generation, had a snug house and farm and $300
in the savings bank at Ashland. One thing, however, he needed, viz,
whisky. The strictest regulations prevailed on the reservation, really
prohibitory to the introduction of spirits, and, indeed, there was at
the nearest town, Ashland, a severe penalty for selling any form of
liquor to an Indian. To obtain whisky, therefore, was the only consideration
which would tempt him to allow a copy of the roll to be taken or
by which he could be induced to recite or rather to chant it in the manner
prescribed. He was undoubtedly accomplished in the knowledge
of the Midē' rites, and the roll, which was shown in his hands, but not
out of them, is substantially the same as one of those copied in the
present work, which was discovered several hundred miles farther
northwest among a different division of the same tribe. The shaman
began rather mildly to plead that he was an old man and could not
remember well unless his spirit was made good by a little whisky.
This difficulty might have been obviated by a traveler’s pocket flask,
but his demands increased with great rapidity. He said that the roll
could only be sung at night, that he must have another old man to help
him, and the old man must have whisky; then that there must be a
number of young men, who would join in the chorus, and all the young
men must have whisky too. These demands made it evident that he
was intending to have a drunken orgy, which resulted in a cloture of
the debate. And yet the idea of the old shaman was in its way correct.
The ceremonial chants could be advantageously pronounced only under
inspiration, which was of old obtained by a tedious form of intoxication,
now expedited by alcohol.</p>

<p>The fact that this work shows a large proportion of pictographs from
the Siouan linguistic family, and especially from the Dakota division of
that family, may be explained partly by the greater familiarity of the
present writer with it than with most other Indian divisions. Yet
probably more distinctive examples of evolution in ideography and in
other details of picture-writing are found still extant among the Dakota
than among any other North American tribe. The degree of advance
made by the Dakota was well expressed by the Rev. S. D. Hinman, who
was born, lived, married, and died in their midst, and, though unfortunately
he committed to writing but little of his knowledge, was more
thoroughly informed about that people than any other man of European
descent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>To express his views clearly he gave to this writer in a manuscript
communication his own classification of pictography (which is not in all
respects approved) as follows:</p>

<p><i>I. Picturing.</i>&mdash;[This is the method called by Prof. Brinton (<i>b</i>) iconographic
writing.] This shows a simple representation of a thing or
event in picture, as of a bear, a man’s hand, a battle.</p>

<p><i>II. Ideography.</i>&mdash;This arbitrarily, though significantly, recalls an idea
or abstract quality, as love or goodness.</p>

<p><i>III. Picture-writing.</i>&mdash;This will, in picture and character, arbitrarily
or otherwise, recite a connected story, there being a picture or character
for every word, even for conjunctions and prepositions.</p>

<p><i>IV. Phonetic writing.</i>&mdash;This gives phonetic value to every picture
and spells out the words by sound, almost as in later alphabets, as if
a lion should stand for the “l” sound, a bear for the “b” sound, etc.,
and from this last by modification came alphabets. [This is the familiar
theory, which is accurate so far as it is applicable, of the initial sound,
but other elements are disregarded, such as the “rebus,” for which
special class Prof. Brinton, loc. cit., has invented the title of the Iconomatic
method.]</p>

<p>Accepting this chronologic if not evolutionary arrangement, Mr.
Hinman decided that the Dakota picture-writing had passed through
stage I and was already entering upon stage II when it was first
observed by the European explorers. Of III and IV he found no examples
in Dakota pictography, though in sign language the Dakota
had progressed further and had entered upon III.</p>

<p>As a summary of the topic it seems that pictographs other than petroglyphs
which presumably are more modern than most of the latter,
can be studied, not by geographic distribution, but by their ascertainable
intent and use. Unless the classification of the remaining
part of this work under its various headings has been defective, further
discussion in this chapter is unnecessary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="subhead">SUBSTANCES ON WHICH PICTOGRAPHS ARE MADE.</span></h2>


<p>Substances on which pictographs are made may be divided <span class="lock">into&mdash;</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I. The human body.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">II. Natural objects other than the human body.</span><br />

<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE HUMAN BODY.</span></h3>

<p>Markings on human bodies are&mdash;(1) Those expressed by painting
or such coloration as is not permanent. It has been found convenient
to treat this topic under the heading of “Significance of Colors,” Chap.
<span class="smcap lowercase">XVIII</span>, Sec. <a href="#page618">3</a>. (2) Those of intended permanence upon the skin, generally
called tattoo, but including scarification. This enormous and
involved topic is discussed, so far as space allows, under the heading of
“Totems, Titles, and Names,” Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span>, Sec. <a href="#page391">3</a>, where it seems to be
most convenient in the general arrangement of this work. Though
logically it might have been divided among several of the headings,
that course would have involved much repetition or cross reference.</p>


<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">NATURAL OBJECTS OTHER THAN THE HUMAN BODY.</span></h3>

<p>Other natural objects may be divided into&mdash;(1) Stone; (2) bone; (3)
skins; (4) feathers and quills; (5) gourds; (6) shells; (7) earth and
sand; (8) copper; (9) wood.</p>


<h4>STONE.</h4>

<p>This caption comprises the pictographs upon stone surfaces or tablets
which are not of the dimensions or in the position to be included
under the heading of petroglyphs, as elsewhere defined. Accounts,
with and without illustrations, have been published of several engraved
tablets, regarding which there has been much discussion, and some examples
appear, infra, under the appropriate heading. (See Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XXII</span>,
Sec. <a href="#page761">1</a>.) Other examples, in which the genuine aboriginal character of
the work is undisputed, appear in the present work, and a large number
of other engraved and incised stone objects could be referred to, some
of which are in the possession of the Bureau of Ethnology, unpublished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206">[206]</a></span>
others being figured in its several reports. It is sufficient now for illustration
of this subject to refer to the account accompanying Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page733">LI</a></span>, infra,
describing and copying the Thruston tablet, which is, perhaps, the
most interesting of any pictograph on stone yet discovered, the genuineness
of which as Indian work has not been called in question.</p>


<h4>BONE.</h4>

<p>For instances of the use of bone, several Alaskan and Eskimo carvings
figured in this work may be referred to, e. g., Figs. <a href="#page383">334</a>, <a href="#page351">459</a>-<a href="#page352">462</a>,

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 157.</span>&mdash;Comanche drawing on shoulder-blade.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 157, copied from
Schoolcraft (<i>e</i>), is taken
from the shoulder-blade of
a buffalo found on the plains
in the Comanche country
of Texas. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a symbol showing the
strife for the buffalo existing
between the Indian and white
races. The Indian (1) presented
on horseback, protected by his
ornamented shield and armed
with a lance, (2) kills a Spaniard
(3) after a circuitous chase (6),
the latter being armed with a
gun. His companion (4), armed
with a lance, shares the same
fate.</p></div>

<p>It may be questioned
whether Mr. Schoolcraft
was not too active in the
search for symbols in his
explanation of (6) as a circuitous
chase. The device
is either a lasso or a lariat,
and relates to the possession
or attempt to take possession
of the buffalo. The
design (5), however, well
expresses ideographically
the fact that the buffalo at
the time was in contention,
and therefore was the property half of the Indians and half of the
whites.</p>


<h4>SKINS.</h4>

<p>A large number of pictographs upon the hides of animals are mentioned
in the present paper. Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XX</span>, with its description in the Dakota<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207">[207]</a></span>
Winter Counts, infra, Chap, <span class="smcap lowercase">X</span>, Sec. <a href="#page266">2</a>, is one instance. Rawhide drum-heads
are also used to paint upon, as by the shamans of the Ojibwa.</p>

<p>The use of robes made of the hides of buffalo and other large animals,
painted with biographic, shamanistic, and other devices, is also mentioned
in various parts of this work. A description of very early observation
is now introduced, taken from John Ribault in Hakluyt (<i>a</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The king gaue our Captaine at his departure a plume or fanne of Hernshawes
feathers died in red, and a basket made of Palmeboughes after the Indian fashion,
and wrought very artificially and a great skinne painted and drawen throughout
with the pictures of diuers wilde beasts so liuely drawen and pourtrayed, that nothing
lacked but life.</p></div>

<p>With the American use of pictographic robes may be compared the
following account of the same use by Australian natives by Dr. Richard
Andree (<i>b</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inner side of the opossum skins worn by the blacks is also often ornamented
with figures. They scratch lines into the skin, which afterward are rubbed over
with fat and charcoal.</p></div>


<h4>FEATHERS AND QUILLS.</h4>

<p>Edward M. Kern, in Schoolcraft (<i>f</i>), reports that the Sacramento
tribes of California were very expert in weaving blankets of feathers,
many of them having beautiful figures worked upon them.</p>

<p>The feather work in Mexico, Central America, and the Hawaiian
Islands is well known, often having designs properly to be considered
among pictographs, though in modern times not often passing beyond
ornamentation.</p>

<p>Worsnop (op. cit.) mentions that on grand occasions of the “Mindarie”
(i. e., peace festival) the Australian natives decorate the bodies, face,
legs, and feet with the down of wild fowl, stuck on with their own blood.
The ceremony of taking the blood is very painful, yet they stand it
without a murmur. It takes five or six men four to five hours to
decorate one man. The blood is put on the body wet and the down
stuck on the blood, showing, when finished, outlines of man’s head, face,
feet, snakes, emu, fish, trees, birds, and other outlines representing the
moon, stars, sun, and Aurora Australis, the whole meaning that they
are at peace with the world.</p>

<p>Mr. David Boyle (<i>a</i>) gives an account of a piece of porcupine quill
work, with an illustration, a part of which is copied in Fig. 158.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the lost or almost lost arts of the Canadian Indians is that of employing
porcupine quills as in the illustration. Partly on account of scarcity of material,
but chiefly, it is likely, from change of habits and of taste, there are comparatively
few Indian women now living who attempt to produce any fabric of this kind. * * *</p>

<p>The central figure is meant to represent the eagle or great thunder-bird, the belief
in which is, or was, widely spread among the Indians over the northern part of this
continent. * * *</p>

<p>This beautiful piece of quill work was produced from Ek-wah-satch, who resides
at Baptiste lake. He informed me that it had belonged to his grandfather, who
resided near Georgian bay.</p></div>

colored porcupine quills.</p>


<h4>GOURDS.</h4>

<p>After gourds have dried the contents are removed and small pebbles
or bones placed in the empty vessel. Handles are sometimes attached.
They serve as rattles in dances and in religious and shamanistic rites.
The representations of natural
or mythical objects, connected
with the ceremonies, for which
the owner may have special
reverence are often depicted
upon their outer surfaces.
This custom prevails among
the Pueblos generally, and
also among many other tribes,
notably those of the Siouan
linguistic stock.</p>

<p>Fig. 159 is a drawing of the
Sci-Manzi or “Mescal Woman”
of the Kiowa as it appears
on a sacred gourd rattle
in the mescal ceremony of that
tribe, and was procured with
full explanations in the winter
of 1890-’91 by Mr. James Mooney of the Bureau of Ethnology.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 159.</span>&mdash;Pictograph
on gourd.</div>
</div>

<p>It shows the rude semblance of a woman, with divergent rays about
her head, a fan in her left hand, and a star under her feet.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the drawing is its hermeneutic character, which is
rarely ascertained by actual evidence as existing among the North
American Indians. It has a double meaning, and
while apparently only a fantastic figure of a woman, it
conveys also to the minds of the initiated a symbolic
representation of the interior of the sacred mescal
lodge. Turning the rattle with the handle toward the
east, the lines forming the halo about the head of the
figure represent the circle of devotees within the lodge.
The head itself, with the spots for eyes and mouth,
represents the large consecrated mescal which is placed
upon a crescent-shaped mound of earth in the center of
the lodge, this mound being represented in the figure
by a broad, curving line, painted yellow, forming the
curve of the shoulders. Below this is a smaller crescent curve,
the original surface of the gourd, which symbolizes the smaller
crescent mound of ashes built up within the crescent of earth as the
ceremony progresses. The horns of both crescents point toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209">[209]</a></span>
door of the lodge on the east side which, in the figure, is toward
the feet. In the chest of the body is a round globule painted red,
emblematic of the fire within the horns of the crescent in the lodge.
The lower part of the body is green, symbolic of the eastern ocean
beyond which dwells the mescal woman who is the ruling spirit or
divinity to whom prayers are addressed in the ceremony, and the star
under her feet is the morning star which heralds her approach. In her
left hand is a device representing the fan of eagle feathers used to
shield the eyes from the glare of the fire during the ceremony.</p>


<h4>SHELLS.</h4>

<p>The admirable and well illustrated paper, Art in Shell of the Ancient
Americans, by Mr. W. H. Holmes, in the Second Annual Report of the
Bureau of Ethnology, and a similar paper, Burial Mounds of the Northern
Section of the United States, by Prof. Cyrus Thomas, in the Fifth
Annual Report of the same Bureau, render unnecessary present extended
discussion under this head.</p>

<div class="caption">BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY TENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XV<br />POWHATAN’S MANTLE.</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Edward B. Tylor (<i>a</i>) gives a description of the mantle copied
upon that plate, which is condensed as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among specimens illustrative of native North American arts, as yet untouched by
European influence, is the deerskin mantle ornamented with shellwork, recorded to
have belonged to the Virginian chief, Powhatan. Of the group of Virginian mantles
in Tradescant’s collection there only now remains this shell embroidered one. It is
entered as follows in the MS. catalogue of the Ashmolean Museum, in the handwriting
of the keeper, Dr. Plot, the well-known antiquary, about 1685: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">205 Basilica Powhatan
Regis Virginiani vestis, duabus cervorum cutibus consuta, et nummis indicis
vulgo cori’s dictis splendidè exornata.</span>” He had at first written “Roanoke,” but
struck his pen through this word, and wrote “cori’s” (i. e. cowries) above, thus by
no means improving the accuracy of his description.</p>

<p>The mantle measures about 2.2<sup>m</sup> in length by 1.6<sup>m</sup> in width. The two deerskins
forming it are joined down the middle; no hair remains. The ornamental design
consists of an upright human figure in the middle; divided by the seam; a pair of
animals; 32 spirally-formed rounds (2 in the lowest line have lost their shells) and
the remains of some work in the right lower corner. The marks where shellwork
has come away plainly show the hind legs and tapering tails of both animals. It is
uncertain whether the two quadrupeds represent in the conventional manner of picture-writing
some real animal of the region, or some mythical composite creature
such as other Algonquin tribes are apt to figure. The decorative shellwork is of a
kind well known in North America. The shells used are <i>Marginella</i>; so far as Mr.
Edgar A. Smith is able to identify them in their present weathered state, <i>M. nivosa</i>.
They have been prepared for fastening on, in two different ways, which may be distinguished
in the plate. In the animals and rounds, the shells have been perforated
by grinding on one side, so that a sinew thread can be passed through the hole thus
made and the mouth. In the man, the shells are ground away and rounded off at
both ends into beads looking roughly ball-like at a distance.</p></div>

<p>The artistic skill of the North American Indians was not, as a rule,
directed to represent the forms of animals with such accuracy as to
allow of their identification as portraitures. Instead of attempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210">[210]</a></span>
such accuracy they generally selected some prominent feature such as
the claws of the bear, which were drawn with exaggeration, or the tail
of the mountain lion which was portrayed of abnormal length over the
animal’s back. Those animals were, therefore, recognized by those
selected features in much the same manner as if there had been a
written legend&mdash;“this is a bear” or “a mountain lion,” the want of
iconographic accuracy being admitted. In the animals represented
on the mantle no such indicating feature is obvious, and the general
resemblance to the marten is the only guide to identification.</p>

<p>The habitat of the marten does not include Virginia as a whole, but
the animal is found in the elevated regions of that state. This local
infrequency is not, however, of much significance. If regarded as a
clan totem, as is probable, it may well be that the clan of Powhatan was
connected with the clans of the more northern Algonquian tribes among
whom the marten frequently appears as a clan totem. What is generally
termed the Powhatan confederacy was a union, not apparently ancient,
of a large number of tribal divisions or villages, and it is not known to
which clan (probably extending through many of these tribal divisions)
the head chief Powhatan belonged. There is almost nothing on record
of the clan system of those Virginian Indians, but it is supposed to be
similar to that of the northern and eastern members of the same linguistic
family, among whom the marten clan was and still is found.</p>

<p>The topic of wampum which, considered as to its material, belongs to
the division of shellwork, is with regard to the purposes of the present
paper, discussed under the head of “Mnemonic,” Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span>, Sec. <a href="#page228">3</a>.</p>


<h4>EARTH AND SAND.</h4>

<p>The highly important work, The Mountain Chant, a Navajo Ceremony,
in the Fifth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, by Dr.
Washington Matthews, U. S. Army, and that of Mr. James Stevenson,
Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the
Navajo Indians, in the Eighth Annual Report of that Bureau, give
accounts of most interesting sand paintings by the Navajo Indians,
which were before unknown. These paintings were made upon the
surface of the earth by means of sand, ashes, and powdered vegetable
and mineral matter of various colors. They were highly elaborate,
and were fashioned with care and ceremony immediately preceding the
observance of specific rites, at the close of which they were obliterated
with great nicety. The subject is further discussed by Dr. W. H. Corbusier,
U. S. Army, in the present paper (see Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV</span>, <a href="#page505">Sec. 5</a>).</p>

<p>Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing, of the Bureau of Ethnology, kindly
contributes the following remarks with special reference to the Zuñi:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A study of characteristic features in these so-called sand pictures of the Navajos
would seem to indicate a Pueblo origin of the art, this notwithstanding the fact that
it is to-day more highly developed or at least more extensively practiced amongst
the Navajos than now, or perhaps ever, amongst the Pueblos. When, during my first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211">[211]</a></span>
sojourn with the Zuñi, I found this art practice in vogue among the tribal priest
magicians and members of cult societies, I named it dry or powder painting. I
could see at a glance that this custom of powder painting had resulted from the
effort to transfer from a vertical, smooth, and stable surface, which could be painted
on, to a horizontal and unstable surface, unsuited to like treatment, such symbolic
and sacramental pictographs as are painted on the walls of the kivas, temporarily,
as appurtenances to the dramaturgic ceremonials of the cult societies, and as supposed
aids to the magical incantations and formulæ of all the monthly, semiannual,
and quadrennial observances and fasts of the tribal priests; sometimes, also, in the
curative or “Betterment” ceremonials of these priests. It is noteworthy that, with
the exception of the invariable “Earth terrace,” “Pathway of (earth) life,” and a
few other conventional symbols of mortal or earthly things (nearly always made of
scattered prayer meal), powder painting is resorted to amongst the Zuñi only in
ceremonials pertaining to <i>all</i> the regions or inclusive of the <i>lower</i> region. In such
cases paintings typical of the North, West, South, and East are made on the four
corresponding walls of the kiva, whilst the lower region is represented by appropriately
powder or paint colored sand on the floor, and the upper region either by
paintings on the walls near the ceiling or on stretched skins suspended from the latter.
Thus the origin of the practice of floor powder painting may be seen to have
resulted from the effort to represent with more dramatic appropriateness or exactness
the lower as well as the other sacramental regions, and to have been incident
to the growth from the quaternary of the sextenary or septenary system of world
division so characteristic of Pueblo culture. Hence it is that I attribute the art of
powder or sand painting to the Pueblos, and believe that it was introduced both by
imitation and by the adoption of Pueblo men amongst the Navajos. Its greater
prevalence amongst them to-day is simply due to the fact that having, as a rule, no
suitable vertical or wall surfaces for pictorial treatment, all their larger ceremonial
paintings have to be made on the ground, and can only or best be made, of course,
by this means alone.</p>

<p>It is proper to add, as having a not inconsiderable bearing on the absence generally
of screen or skin painting among the Navajos, that, with the Pueblos at least,
these pictures are&mdash;must be&mdash;only temporary; for they are supposed to be spiritually
shadowed, so to say, or breathed upon by the gods or god animals they represent,
during the appealing incantations or calls of the rites; hence the paint substance of
which they are composed is in a way incarnate, and at the end of the ceremonial must
be killed and disposed of as dead if evil, eaten as medicine if good.</p>

<p>Further light is thrown on this practice of the Zuñi in making use of these suppositively
vivified paintings by their kindred practice of painting not only fetiches
of stone, etc., and sometimes of larger idols, then of washing the paint off for use as
above described, but also of <i>powder painting in relief</i>; that is, of modeling effigies in
sand, sometimes huge in size, of hero or animal gods, sacramental mountains, etc.,
powder painting them in common with the rest of the pictures, and afterwards removing
the paint for medicinal or further ceremonial use.</p></div>

<p>The construction of the effigies in high relief last above mentioned
should be compared with the effigy mounds mentioned below in this
section.</p>

<p>In connection with the ceremonial use, for temporary dry painting
on the ground, of colored earth and sand and also that of sacred corn
meal, a remarkable parallel is found in India. Mr. Edward Carpenter
(<i>a</i>) mentions that the Devadásis, who are popularly called Nautch girls,
as a part of their duty, ornament the floor of the Hindu temples with
quaint figures drawn in rice flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The well known mounds or tumuli more or less distinctly representing
animal forms and sometimes called effigy mounds, found chiefly in
Wisconsin and Illinois, come in this category, but it is not possible to
properly discuss them and also give space to the many other topics in
this paper, the facts and authorities upon which are less known or less
accessible. A large amount of information is published by Rev. S. D.
Peet (<i>a</i>). Other articles are by Mr. T. H. Lewis in Science, September
7, 1888, and No. 318, 1889. One upon the Serpent mound of Ohio, by
Prof. F. W. Putnam (<i>a</i>), is of special interest. It may be suggested as
a summation that there is not sufficient evidence of the erection of this
class of effigy mounds merely for burial purposes. They seldom exceeded
6 feet in height and varied in expanse from 30 to 300 feet. The
animals most frequently recognizable in the constructions are lizards,
birds, and several more or less distinct quadrupeds; serpents and
turtles also are identified. The species of fauna represented are those
now or lately found in the same region. There is a strong probability
that the forms of the mounds in question were determined by totemic
superstitions or tribal habitudes.</p>

<p>In England the pictographs styled “turf monuments” are sometimes
made by cutting the natural turf and filling with chalk the part of the
surface thus laid bare. Sometimes the color depends wholly upon the
limestone, granite, or other rock exposed by removing the turf. Rev.
W. C. Plenderleath (<i>a</i>) gives a full account of this variety of pictograph.</p>


<h4>COPPER.</h4>

<p>This is the only metal on which it is probable that the North American
Indians made designs. To present comparisons of pictures by other
peoples on that or other metals or alloys would be to enter into a field,
the most interesting part of which is classed as numismatic, and which
would be a departure from the present heading. That virgin copper
was used for diverse purposes, generally ornamental, by the North
American Indians, is now established, and there is a presentation of
the subject in Prof. Cyrus Thomas’s (<i>a</i>) Burial Mounds. The most distinct
and at the same time surprising account of a true pictographic
record on copper is given by W. W. Warren (<i>a</i>), an excellent authority,
and is condensed as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Ojibwa of the Crane family hold in their possession a circular plate of virgin
copper, on which are rudely marked indentations and hieroglyphics denoting the number
of generations of the family who have passed away since they first pitched their
lodges at Shang-a-waum-ik-ong and took possession of the adjacent country, including
the island of La Pointe.</p>

<p>When I witnessed this curious family register in 1843 it was exhibited to my
father. The old chief kept it carefully buried in the ground and seldom displayed
it. On this occasion he brought it to view only at the entreaty of my mother
whose maternal uncle he was.</p>

<p>On this plate of copper were marked eight deep indentations, denoting the number
of his ancestors who had passed away since they first lighted their fire at Shang-a-waum-ik-ong.
They had all lived to a good old age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>By the rude figure of a man with a hat on its head, placed opposite one of these
indentations, was denoted the period when the white race first made its appearance
among them. This mark occurred in the third generation, leaving five generations
which had passed away since that important era in their history.</p></div>

<p>Mr. I. W. Powell (<i>a</i>), Indian superintendent, in the report of the
deputy superintendent-general of Indian affairs of Canada for 1879,
gives an account of some tribes of the northwest coast, especially the
Indians called in the report Newittees, a tribe now known as the
Naqómqilis of the Wakashan family, who treasure pieces of copper
peculiarly shaped and marked. The shape is that of one face of a truncated
pyramid with the base upward. In the broad end appear marks
resembling the holes for eyes and mouth, which are common in masks of
the human face. The narrower end has a rough resemblance to an ornamental
collar. These copper articles were made by the Indians originally
from the native copper, and in 1879 a few were held by the chiefs
who used them for presentation at the potlaches or donation feasts. The
value which is attached to these small pieces of copper, which are
intrinsically worthless, is astounding. For one of them 1,200 blankets
were paid, which would at the time and place represent $1,800. Sometimes
a chief in presenting one of them, in order to show his utter disregard
of wealth, would break it into three or four pieces and give
them away, each fragment being perhaps repurchased at an exorbitant
sum. This competition in extravagance for display, under the guise of
charity and humility, has had parallels in the silver-brick and flour-barrel
auctions in parts of the United States, when the actors were
white citizens. Apart from such public exhibitions, the copper tokens
seem to partake of the natures both of fiat money and of talismans.</p>


<h4>WOOD.</h4>

<p>This division comprises:</p>

<p>(1) <i>The living tree</i>, of the use of which for pictographic purposes
there are many descriptions and illustrations in this paper. In addition
to them may be noted the remark made by Bishop De Schweinitz (<i>a</i>)
in the Life and Times of Zeisberger, that in 1750 there were numerous
tree carvings at a place on the eastern shore of Cayuga lake, the meaning
of which was known to and interpreted by the Cayuga Indians.</p>

<p>This mode of record or notice is so readily suggested that it is found
throughout the world, e. g., the “hieroglyph” in New Guinea, described
by D’Albertis (<i>a</i>), being a drawing in black on a white tree.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Bark.</i>&mdash;The Abnaki and Ojibwa have been and yet continue to
be in the habit of incising pictographic characters and mnemonic
marks upon birch bark. Many descriptions and illustrations of this
style are given in this paper, and admirable colored illustrations of it
also appear in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XIX</span> of the Seventh Ann. Rept. Bureau of Ethnology.
The lines appear sometimes to have been traced on the inner surface of
young bark with a sharply pointed instrument, probably bone, but in
other examples the drawings are made by simple puncturing. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214">[214]</a></span>
strips of bark, varying from an inch to several feet in length, roll up
after drying, and are by heating straightened out for examination.</p>

<p>Another mode of drawing on birch bark which appears to be peculiar
to the Abnaki is by scratching the exterior surface, thus displaying a
difference in color between the outermost and the second layer of the
rind, which difference forms the figure. The lower character in Pl.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page225">XVI</a></span> shows this mode of picturing. It is an exact copy of part of an old
bark record made by the Abnaki of Maine.</p>

<p>They also use the mode of incision, many examples of which appear
in the present work, but their mode of scratching produced a much
more picturesque effect, as is shown also in Fig. <a href="#page473">659</a>, than the mere linear
drawing.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Manufactured wood.</i>&mdash;The Indians of the northwest coast generally
employ wood as the material on which their pictographs are to be
made. Totem posts, boats, boat paddles, the boards constituting the
front wall of a house, and wooden masks, are among the objects used.</p>

<p>Many drawings among the Indians of the interior parts of the United
States are also found upon pipestems made of wood, usually ash.
Among the Arikara boat paddles are used upon which marks of personal
distinction are reproduced, as shown in Fig. <a href="#page442">578</a>.</p>

<p>Mortuary records are also drawn upon slabs of wood. (See Figs. <a href="#page521">728</a>
and <a href="#page522">729</a>). Mnemonic devices, notices of departure, distress, etc., are
also drawn upon slips of wood.</p>

<p>The examples of the use of wood for pictographs which are illustrated
and described in this paper are too numerous for recapitulation; to
them, however, may be added the following from Wilkes’s (<i>a</i>) Exploring
Expedition, referring to Fig. 160.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/dp275_pg214.png" width="500" height="216" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 160.</span>&mdash;Pictographs on wood, Washington.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Near an encampment on Chickeeles river, near Puget Sound, Washington, were
found some rudely carved painted planks, of which Mr. Eld made a drawing. These
planks were placed upright and nothing could be learned of their origin. The colors
were exceedingly bright, of a kind of red pigment.</p></div>

<p>Mr. James O. Pattie (<i>a</i>) gives an account of a wooden passport given
to him in 1824 by a Pawnee chief. He describes it, without illustration,
as a small piece of wood curiously painted with characters something
like “hieroglyphics.” The chief told Mr. Pattie’s party if they saw
any of his warriors to give them the stick, in which case they would be
kindly treated, which promise was fulfilled a few days later when the
party met a large band of the same tribe on the warpath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215">[215]</a></span></p>


<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">ARTIFICIAL OBJECTS.</span></h3>

<p>Artificial objects may be classified, so far as is important for the
present work, into, I, fictile fabrics and, II, textile fabrics.</p>


<h4>FICTILE FABRICS.</h4>

<p>A large number of articles of pottery bearing pictographs are figured
in the illustrated collections by Mr. James Stevenson in the
Second Annual Report, and by Mr. Stevenson and Mr. William H.
Holmes in the Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. Pipes
on which totemic designs and property marks appear are also common.</p>

<p>The art of pottery was at first limited to vessel-making. In the
earlier stages of culture, vases were confined to simple use as receptacles,
but as culture ripened they were advanced to ceremonial and religious
offices and received devices and representations in color and in relief
connected with the cult to which they were devoted. Among some tribes
large burial vases were fashioned to contain or cover the dead. An infinite
variety of objects, such as pipes, whistles, rattles, toys, beads,
trowels, calendars, masks, and figurines, were made of pottery. Clays
of varying degrees of purity were used, and sometimes these were tempered
with powdered quartz, shell, or like materials. The vessels
were frequently built by coiling. The surface was smoothed by the hands
or the modeling implement or was polished with a stone or other
smoothing tool. Much attention was given to surface embellishment.
The finger nails and various pointed tools were used to scarify and indent,
and elaborate figures and designs were incised. Stamps with
systematically worked designs were sometimes applied to the soft clay.
Cords and woven fabrics were also employed to give diversity to the
surface. With the more advanced tribes, though these simple processes
were still resorted to, engraving, modeling in relief and in the round,
and painting in colors were employed.</p>


<h4>TEXTILE FABRICS.</h4>

<p>Textile fabrics include those products of art in which the elements
of their construction are filamental and mainly combined by using their
flexibility. The processes employed are called wattling, interlacing,
plaiting, netting, weaving, sewing, and embroidery. The materials
generally used by primitive people were pliable vegetal growths, such
as twigs, leaves, roots, canes, rushes, and grasses, and the hair, quills,
feathers, and tendons of animals.</p>

<p>Unlike works in stone and clay, textile articles are seldom long preserved.
Still, from historic accounts and a study of the many beautiful
articles produced by existing Indian tribes, a fair knowledge of the
range and general character of native fabrics may be obtained. In
many cases buried articles of that character have been preserved by
the impregnation of the engirding earths with preservative salts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216">[216]</a></span>
also some fabrics which had been wrapped about buried utensils, or
ornaments of copper remained without serious decay. Charring has
also been a means of preserving cloth, and much has been learned of
the weaving done by ancient workers through impressions upon pottery
which had been made by applying the texture while the clay was still
soft. The weaving appliances were simple, but the results in plain and
figured fabrics, in tapestry, in lace-like embroideries, and in feather-work
are admirable.</p>

<p>This subject is discussed by Mr. W. H. Holmes in his paper, A Study
of the Textile Art, etc., in the Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of
Ethnology, in a manner so comprehensive as to embrace the field of
pictography in its relation to woven articles.</p>

<p>Several examples of this application also appear in the present work.

<p>Some of the California tribes are expert workers in grass and roots
in the manufacture of baskets, upon which designs other than for mere
ornamentation are frequently worked. The Yokuts, at Tule river
Agency, in the southeastern part of the State, sometimes incorporate
various human forms in which the arms are suspended at the sides of
the body with the hands directed outward to either side. Above the
head is a heavy horizontal line.</p>

on to the garment (ornamenting it with borders of beads and buttons) by the method
known as appliqué work; another method is to sew pieces of bright abalone or pearl
shell or pearl buttons on to the garment in the totemic patterns. The illustration

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="subhead">INSTRUMENTS AND MATERIALS BY WHICH PICTOGRAPHS
ARE MADE.</span></h2>


<p>So far as appears on ancient pictographic works the kind of instruments
and materials with which they were made can be inferred only
from its aspect, though microscopic examination and chemical analysis
have sometimes been successfully applied. A few examples relating
to the topic are given as follows, though other descriptions appear elsewhere
in this treatise.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">INSTRUMENTS FOR CARVING.</span></h3>

<p>This title, as here used, is intended to include cutting, pecking,
scratching, and rubbing. The Hidatsa, when scratching upon stone or
rocks, as well as upon pieces of wood, employ a sharply pointed piece
of hard stone, usually a fragment of quartz. The present writer successfully
imitated the Micmac scratchings at Kejimkoojik lake, Nova
Scotia, by using a stone arrow point upon the slate rocks.</p>

<p>The bow-drill was largely used by the Innuit of Alaska in carving
bone and ivory. Their present method of cutting figures and other
characters is by a small steel blade, thick, though sharply pointed, resembling
a graver.</p>

<p>Many petroglyphs, e. g., those at Conowingo, Maryland, at Machiasport,
Maine, and in Owens valley, California, present every evidence
of having been deepened if not altogether fashioned by rubbing, either
with a piece of wood and sand or with pointed stone.</p>

<p>To incise or indent lines upon birch bark the Ojibwa, Ottawa, and
other Algonquian tribes used a sharply pointed piece of bone, though
they now prefer an iron nail. Examples of scratching upon the outer
surface of bark are mentioned elsewhere.</p>

<p>Several examples of producing characters on stone by pecking with
another stone are mentioned in this paper, and Mr. J. D. McGuire (<i>a</i>), of
Ellicott City, Maryland, has been remarkably successful in forming
petroglyphs with the ordinary Indian stone hammer. Some of the results
established by him are published in The American Anthropologist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219">[219]</a></span></p>


<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">INSTRUMENTS FOR DRAWING.</span></h3>

<p>Drawings upon small slabs of wood, found among the Ojibwa, were
made with a piece of red-hot wire or thin iron rod hammered to a point.
Such figures are blackened by being burned in.</p>

<p>When in haste or when better materials are not at hand, the Hidatsa
sometimes drew upon a piece of wood or the shoulder-blade of a
buffalo with a piece of charcoal from the fire or with a piece of red
chalk or red ocher, with which nearly every warrior is at all times
supplied.</p>

<p>Mr. A. W. Howitt, in Manuscript Notes on Australian Pictographs,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not having any process such as is used by some of the savage tribes to soften skins,
the harshness of these rugs is remedied by marking upon them lines and patterns,
which being partly cut through the skin give to it a certain amount of suppleness.
In former times, before the white man enabled the black fellow to supplement his
meager stock of implements with those of civilization, a Kumai made use of the sharp
edge of a mussel shell (unio) to cut these patterns. At the present time the sharpened
edge of the bowl of a metal spoon is used, partly because it forms a convenient instrument,
partly, perhaps, because its bowl bears a resemblance in shape to the
familiar ancestral tool.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">COLORING MATTER AND ITS APPLICATION.</span></h3>

<p>Painting upon robes or skins is executed by means of thin strips of
wood or sometimes of bone. Tufts of antelope hair are also used, by
tying them to sticks to make a brush, but this is evidently a modern
innovation. Pieces of wood, one end of which is chewed so as to produce
a loose fibrous brush, are also used at times, as has been specially
observed among the Teton Dakota.</p>

<p>The Hidatsa and other Northwest Indians usually employ a piece of
buffalo rib or a piece of hard wood having an elliptical form. This is
dipped in a solution of glue, with or without color, and a tracing is
made, which is subsequently filled up and deepened by a repetition of
the process with the same or a stronger solution of the color.</p>

<p>Of late years in the United States colors of civilized manufacture
are readily obtained by the Indians for painting and decoration. Frequently,
however, when the colors of commerce can not be obtained,
the aboriginal colors are still prepared and used. The ferruginous
clays of various shades of brown, red, and yellow occur in nature so
widely distributed that these are the most common and leading tints.
Black is generally prepared by grinding fragments of charcoal into a
very fine powder. Among some tribes, as has also been found in some
of the “ancient” pottery from the Arizona ruins, clay had evidently
been mixed with charcoal to give better body. The black color made by
some of the Innuit tribes is made with blood and charcoal intimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220">[220]</a></span>
mixed, which is afterwards applied to incisions in ivory, bone, and
wood.</p>

<p>Among the Dakota, colors for dyeing porcupine quills were obtained
chiefly from plants. The vegetable colors, being soluble, penetrate the
substance of the quills more evenly and beautifully than the mineral
colors of eastern manufacture.</p>

<p>The black color of some of the Pueblo pottery is obtained by a special
burning with pulverized manure, into which the vessel is placed as it is
cooling after the first baking. The coloring matter&mdash;soot produced by
smoke&mdash;is absorbed into the pores of the vessel, and does not wear off
as readily as when colors are applied to the surface by brushes.</p>

<p>In decorating skins or robes the Arikara Indians boil the tail of the
beaver, thus obtaining a viscous fluid which is thin glue. The figures
are first drawn in outline with a piece of beef-rib, or some other flat
bone, the edge only being used after having been dipped into the
liquor. The various pigments to be employed in the drawing are
then mixed with some of the same liquid, in separate vessels, when
the various colors are applied to the objects by means of a sharpened
piece of wood or bone. The colored mixture adheres firmly to the
original tracing in glue.</p>

<p>When similar colors are to be applied to wood, the surface is frequently
pecked or slightly incised to receive the color more readily.</p>

<p>Jacques Cartier, in Hakluyt (<i>b</i>), reports the Indian women of the Bay
of Chaleur as smearing the face with coal dust and grease.</p>

<p>A small pouch, discovered on the Yellowstone river in 1873, which
had been dropped by some fleeing hostile Sioux, contained several fragments
of black micaceous iron. The latter had almost the appearance
and consistence of graphite, so soft and black was the result upon rubbing
with it. It had evidently been used for decorating the face as
war-paint.</p>

<p>Mr. Wm. H. Dall (<i>a</i>), treating of the remains found in the mammalian
layers in the Amakuak cave, Unalaska, remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the remains of a woman’s work-basket, found in the uppermost layer in a cave,
were bits of this resin [from the bark of pine or spruce driftwood], evidently carefully
treasured, with a little birch-bark case (the bark also derived from drift logs)
containing pieces of soft hematite, graphite, and blue carbonate of copper, with
which the ancient seamstress ornamented her handiwork.</p></div>

<p>The same author reports (<i>f</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The coloration of wooden articles with native pigments is of ancient origin, but all
the more elaborate instances that have come to my knowledge bore marks of comparatively
recent origin. The pigments used were blue carbonates of iron and copper;
the green fungus, or peziza, found in decayed birch and alder wood; hematite
and red chalk; white infusorial or chalky earth; black charcoal, graphite, and micaceous
ore of iron. A species of red was sometimes derived from pine bark or the
cambium of the ground willow.</p></div>

<p>Stephen Powers (<i>a</i>) states that the Shastika women “smear their faces
all over daily with choke-cherry juice, which gives them a bloody, corsair
aspect.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. A. S. Gatschet, of the Bureau of Ethnology, reports that the
Klamaths of southwestern Oregon employ a black color, lgú, made of
burnt plum seeds and bulrushes, which is applied to the cheeks in the
form of small round spots. This is used during dances. Red paint, for
the face and body, is prepared from a resin exuding from the spruce
tree, pánam. A yellow mineral paint is also employed, consisting probably
of ocher or ferruginous clay. He also says that the Klamath
spál, yellow mineral paint, is of light yellow color, but turns red when
burned, after which it is applied in making small round dots upon the
face. The white infusorial clay is applied in the form of stripes or
streaks over the body. The Klamaths use charcoal, lgúm, in tattooing.</p>

<p>Mud and white clay were used by the Winnebago for the decoration
of the human body and of horses. Some of the California Indians in the
vicinity of Tulare river used a white coloring matter, consisting of infusorial
earth, obtained there. The tribes at and near the geysers
north of San Francisco bay procured vermilion from croppings of cinnabar.
The same report is made with probability of truth concerning
the Indians at the present site of the New Almaden mines, where tribes
of the Mutsun formerly lived. Some of the black coloring matter of
pictographs in Santa Barbara, California, proved on analysis to be a
hydrous oxide of manganese. The Mojave pigments are ocher, clay,
and charcoal mingled with oil.</p>

<p>Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, of the Bureau of Ethnology, reports regarding
the Osage that one of their modes of obtaining black color for the face
was by burning a quantity of small willows. When these were charred
they were broken in small pieces and placed in pans, with a little
water in each. The hands were then dipped into the pan and rubbed
together and finally rubbed over the parts to be colored.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoffman reports that among the Hualpai, living on the western
border of the Colorado plateau, Arizona, some persons appeared as if
they had been tattooed in vertical bands from the forehead to the
waist, but upon closer examination it was found that dark and light
bands of the natural skin were produced in the following manner: When
a deer or an antelope had been killed the blood was rubbed over the
face and breast, after which the spread and curved fingers were
scratched downward from the forehead over the face and breast, thus
removing some of the blood; that remaining soon dried and gave the
appearance of black stripes. The exposed portion of the skin retained
the natural dark-tanned color, while that under the coating of coagulated
blood became paler by being protected against the light and air.
These persons did not wash off the marks and after a while the blood
began to drop off by desquamation, leaving lighter spots and lines
which for a week or two appear like tattoo marks. Similar streaks
of blood have been held to have originated tattoo designs in several
parts of the world to record success in hunting or in war, but such
evolution does not appear to have resulted from the transient decoration
in the case mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well known that the meal of maize called kunque is yet commonly
used by the Zuñi for ceremonial coloration of their own persons
and of objects used in their religious rites. Hoddentin is less familiarly
known. It is the pollen of the tule, which is a variety of cat-tail
rush growing in all the ponds of the southwestern parts of the United
States. It is a yellow powder with which small buckskin bags are
filled and those bags then attached to the belts of Apache warriors.
They are also worn as amulets by members of the tribe. In dances for
the cure of sickness the shaman applied the powder to the forehead of
the patient, then to his breast in the figure of a cross; next he sprinkles
it in a circle around his couch, then on the heads of the chanters and
the assembled friends of the patient, and lastly upon his own head and
into his own mouth.</p>

<p>Everard F. im Thurn (<i>c</i>) gives the following details concerning British
Guiana:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The dyes used by the Indians to paint their own bodies, and occasionally to draw
patterns on their implements, are red faroah, purple caraweera, blue-black lana,
white felspathic clay and, though very rarely, a yellow vegetable dye of unknown
origin.</p>

<p>Faroah is the deep red pulp around the seed of a shrub (<i>Bixa orellana</i>) which
grows wild on the banks of some of the rivers, and is cultivated by the Indians in
their clearings. It is mixed with a large quantity of oil. When it is to be used
either a mass of it is taken in the palm of the hand and rubbed over the skin or
other surface to be painted, or a pattern of fine lines is drawn with it by means of
a stick used as a pencil.</p>

<p>Caraweera is a somewhat similar dye, of a more purplish red, and by no means
so commonly used. It is prepared from the leaves of a yellow-flowered bignonia
(<i>B. chicka</i>) together with some other unimportant ingredients. The dried leaves are
boiled. The pot is then taken from the fire and the contents being poured into
bowls are allowed to subside. The clear water left at the top is poured away and
the sediment is of a beautiful purple color.</p>

<p>Lana is the juice of the fruit of a small tree (<i>Genipa americana</i>) with which without
further preparation, blue-black lines are drawn in patterns, or large surfaces
are stained on the skin. The dye thus applied is for about a week indelible.</p></div>

<p>Paul Marcoy (<i>a</i>), in Travels in South America, says the Passés, Yuris,
Barrés and Chumanas of Brazil, employ a decoction of indigo or genipa
in tattooing.</p>

<p>F. S. Moreat, M. D., in Jour. Roy. Geog. Soc., <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXII</span>, 1862, p. 125,
says that the Andaman Islanders rubbed earth on the top of the head,
probably for the purpose of ornamentation.</p>

<p>Dr. Richard Andree (<i>b</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Long before Europeans came to Australia, the Australian blacks knew a kind of
pictorial representation, exhibiting scenes from their life, illustrating it with great
fidelity to nature. An interesting specimen of that kind was found on a piece of
bark that had served as cover of a hut on Lake Tyrrell. The black who produced
this picture had had intercourse with white people, but had had no instruction
whatever in drawing. The bark was blackened by smoke on the inside, and on
this blackened surface the native drew the figures with his thumb nail.</p></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223">[223]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="subhead">MNEMONIC.</span></h2>


<p>This is the most obvious and probably was the earliest use to which
picture-writing was applied. The contrivance of drawing the representations
of objects, to fix in the memory either the objects themselves
or the concepts, facts, or other matters connected with them, is practiced
early by human individuals and is found among peoples the most
ancient historically or in the horizons of culture. After the adoption
of the characters for purely mnemonic purposes, those at first intended
to be iconographic often became converted into ideographic, emblematic,
or symbolic designs, and perhaps in time so greatly conventionalized
that the images of the things designed could no longer be perceived
by the imagination alone.</p>

<p>It is believed, however, that this form and use of picturing were preceded
by the use of material objects which afterwards were reproduced
graphically in paintings, cuttings, and carvings. In the present paper
many examples appear of objects known to have been so used, the graphic
representations of which, made with the same purpose, are explained
by knowledge of the fact. Other instances are mentioned as connected
with the evolution of pictographs, and they possibly may interpret some
forms of the latter which are not yet understood.</p>

<p>This chapter is divided into (1) knotted cords and objects tied;
(2) notched or marked sticks; (3) wampum; (4) order of songs; (5) traditions;
(6) treaties; (7) appointment; (8) numeration; (9) accounting.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">KNOTTED CORDS AND OBJECTS TIED.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Hoffman reports a device among the Indians formerly inhabiting
the mountain valleys north of Los Angeles, California, who brought or
sent to the settlements blankets, skins, and robes for sale. The man
trusted to transport and sell those articles was provided with a number
of strings made of some flexible vegetable fiber, one string for each
class of goods, which were attached to his belt. Every one confiding an
article to the agent fixed the price, and when he disposed of it a single
knot was tied to the proper cord for each real received, or a double
knot for each peso. Thus any particular string indicated the kind of
goods sold, as well as the whole sum realized for them, which was distributed
according to the account among the former owners of the
goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. George Turner (<i>a</i>) says that among the South Sea Islanders tying
a number of knots in a piece of cord was a common way of noting
and remembering things in the absence of a written language.</p>

<p>A peculiar and ingenious mode of expressing thoughts without pronouncing
or writing them in language is still met with among the Indian
shepherds in the Peruvian Cordilleras, though it is practiced
merely in the accounts of the flocks. This system consists of a peculiar
intertwining of various strings into a net-like braidwork, and the diverse
modes of tying these strings form the record, the knots and loops
signifying definite ideas and their combination the connection of these
ideas. This system of mnemonic device, which was practiced by the ancient
Peruvians, was called quipu, and, though a similar knot-writing
is found in China, Tartary, eastern Asia, on many islands of the Pacific,
and even in some parts of Africa, yet in Peru, at the time of the Incas,
it was so elaborately developed as to permit its employment for official
statistics of the government. Of course, as this writing gave no
picture of a word and did not suggest sounds, but, like the notched
stick, merely recalled ideas already existing, the writing could be
understood by those only who possessed the key to it; but it is noteworthy
that when the Jesuit missions began their work in Peru they
were able to use the quipus for the purpose of making the Indians
learn Latin prayers by heart.</p>

<p>A more detailed account of the ancient quipu is extracted from Dr.
von Tschudi’s Travels in Peru (<i>a</i>) with condensation as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This method consisted in the dexterous intertwining of knots on strings, so as to
render them auxiliaries to the memory. The instrument was composed of one thick
head or top string, to which, at certain distances, thinner ones were fastened. The
top string was much thicker than these pendent strings and consisted of two doubly
twisted threads, over which two single threads were wound. The branches, or
pendent strings, were fastened to the top ones by a single loop; the knots were
made in the pendent strings and were either single or manifold. The length of the
strings was various. The transverse or top string often measures several yards,
and sometimes only a foot; the branches are seldom more than 2 feet long, and in
general they are much shorter.</p>

<p>The strings were often of different colors, each having its own particular signification.
The color for soldiers was red; for gold, yellow; for silver, white; for corn,
green, etc. The quipu was especially employed for numerical and statistical tables;
each single knot representing ten; each double knot stood for one hundred; each
triple knot for one thousand, etc.; two single knots standing together made twenty;
and two double knots, two hundred.</p>

<p>In this manner the ancient Peruvians kept the accounts of their army. On one
string were numbered the soldiers armed with slings; on another the spearmen; on
a third, those who carried clubs, etc. In the same manner the military reports
were prepared. In every town some expert men were appointed to tie the knots of
the quipu and to explain them. These men were called <i>quipucamayocuna</i> (literally,
officers of the knots.) The appointed officers required great dexterity in unriddling
the meaning of the knots. It, however, seldom happened that they had to read
a quipu without some verbal commentary. Something was always required to be
added if the quipu came from a distant province, to explain whether it related to
the numbering of the population, to tributes, or to war, etc. This method of calculation<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225">[225]</a></span>
is still practiced by the shepherds of Puna. On the first branch or string
they usually place the number of the bulls; on the second, that of the cows, the
latter being classed into those which were milked and those which were not milked;
on the next string were numbered the calves according to their ages and sizes. Then
came the sheep, in several subdivisions. Next followed the number of foxes killed,
the quantity of salt consumed, and, finally, the cattle that had been slaughtered.
Other quipus showed the produce of the herds in milk, cheese, wool, etc. Each
list was distinguished by a particular color or by some peculiarity in the twisting
of the string.</p></div>

<p>Other accounts tell that the descendants of the Quiches still use the
quipu, perhaps as modified by themselves, for numeration. They pierce
beans and hang them by different colored strings, each of which represents
one of the column places used in decimal arithmetic. A green
string signifies 1,000; a red one, 100; a yellow, 10, and a white refers
to the 9 smaller digits. Thus if 7 beans are on a green, 2 on a red, 8
on a yellow, and 6 on a white string, and the whole tied together, the
bundle expresses the number 7,286.</p>

<p>Before the time of their acquaintance with the quipus, the Peruvians
used in the same way pebbles or maize-beans of various colors. The
same practice was known in Europe in the prehistoric period. The
habit of many persons in civilized countries to tie a knot in the handkerchief
to recall an idea or fact to mind is a familiar example to show
how naturally the action would suggest itself for the purpose, and perhaps
indicates the inheritance of the practice.</p>

<div class="caption">BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY TENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XVI<br />PERUVIAN QUIPU AND BIRCH BARK DRAWING.</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Andree (<i>b</i>) gives an illustration of a quipu (here reproduced as
part of Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI</span>), which he represents as taken from Perez, and states
that the drawing was made soon after the exhuming of the object from
an ancient Peruvian grave.</p>

<p>Capt. Bourke (<i>a</i>) gives descriptions and illustrations of varieties of
the izze-kloth or medicine cord of the Apache. A condensed extract
of his remarks is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These cords, in their perfection, are decorated with beads and shells strung along
at intervals, with pieces of the sacred green chalchihuitl, which has had such a mysterious
ascendancy over the minds of the American Indians&mdash;Aztec, Peruvian, Quiche,
as well as the more savage tribes like the Apache and Navajo; with petrified wood,
rock crystal, eagle down, claws of the hawk or eaglet, claws of the bear, rattle of
the rattlesnake, buckskin bags of hoddentin, circles of buckskin in which are inclosed
pieces of twigs and branches of trees which have been struck by lightning,
small fragments of the abalone shell from the Pacific coast, and much other sacred
paraphernalia of a similar kind.</p>

<p>That the use of these cords was reserved for the most sacred and important occasions
I soon learned. They were not to be seen on occasions of no moment, but the
dances for war, medicine, and summoning the spirits at once brought them out, and
every medicine man of any consequence would appear with one hanging from his
right shoulder over his left hip.</p>

<p>These cords will protect a man while on the warpath, and many of the Apache
believe firmly that a bullet will have no effect upon the warrior wearing one of
them. This is not their only virtue by any means; the wearer can tell who has
stolen ponies or other property from him or from his friends, can help the crops, and
cure the sick. If the circle attached to one of these cords is placed upon the head
it will at once relieve any ache, while the cross attached to another prevents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226">[226]</a></span>
wearer from going astray, no matter where he may be; in other words, it has some
connection with cross-trails and the four cardinal points, to which the Apache pay
the strictest attention.</p>

<p>I was at first inclined to associate these cords with the quipus of the Peruvians and
also with the wampum of the aborigines of the Atlantic coast, and investigation
only confirms this first suspicion.</p></div>

<p>The praying beads of the Buddhists and of many Oriental peoples,
who have used them from high antiquity, are closely allied to the quipu.
They are more familiar now in the shape of the rosaries of Roman
Catholics. In the absence of manufactured articles, arranged on wires,
the necessary materials were easily procured. Berries, nuts, pease, or
beans strung in any manner answered the purpose. The abacus of the
Chinese and Greeks was connected in origin with the same device.</p>

<p>E. F. im Thurn (<i>d</i>) says of the Nikari-Karu Indians of Guiana:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At last, after four days’ stay, we got off. The two or three people from Euwari-manakuroo
who came with us gave their wives knotted strings of quippus, each
knot representing one of the days they expected to be away, and the whole string
thus forming a calendar to be used by the wives until the return of their husbands.</p></div>

<p>That the general idea or invention for mnemonic purposes appearing
in the quipu was actually used pictorially is indicated in the illustrations
of the sculptures of Santa Lucia Cosumalhuapa in Guatemala
given by Dr. S. Habel (<i>b</i>). Upon these he remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has been frequently affirmed that the aborigines of America had nowhere arisen
high enough in civilization to have characters for writing and numeral signs, but
the sculptures of Santa Lucia exhibit signs which indicate a kind of cipher-writing
higher in form than mere hieroglyphics. From the mouth of most of the human
beings, living or dead, emanates a staff, variously bent, to the sides of which nodes
are attached. These nodes are of different sizes and shapes, and variously distributed
on the sides of the staff, either singly or in twos and threes, the last named
either separated or in shape of a trefoil. This manner of writing not only indicates
that the person is speaking or praying, but also indicates the very words, the contents
of the speech or prayer. It is quite certain that each staff, as bent and ornamented,
stood for a well-known petition, which the priest could read as easily as
those acquainted with a cipher dispatch can know its purport. Further, one may
be allowed to conjecture that the various curves of the staves served the purpose of
strength and rhythm, just as the poet chooses his various meters for the same purpose.</p></div>

<p>The following notices of the ancient mnemonic use of knotted cords
and of its survival in various parts of the world are extracted from the
essay of Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie (<i>d</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Yang tung, south of Khoten, and consequently north of Tibet, who first communicated
with China in A. D. 641, had no written characters. They only cut
notches in sticks and tied knots in strings for records.</p>

<p>The Bratyki and Buriats of Siberia are credited with the use of knotted cords.</p>

<p>The Japanese are also reputed to have employed knots on strings or bind-weeds
for records.</p>

<p>The Li of Hainan, being unacquainted with writing, use knotted cords or notched
sticks in place of bonds or agreements.</p>

<p>In the first half of the present century cord records were still generally used in
the Indian archipelago and Polynesia proper. The tax-gatherers in the island of
Hawaii by this means kept accounts of all the articles collected by them from the
inhabitants. A rope 400 fathoms long was used as a revenue book. It was divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227">[227]</a></span>
into numerous portions corresponding to the various districts of the island; the portions
were under the care of the tax-gatherers, who, with the aid of loops, knots,
and tufts of different shapes, colors, and sizes, were enabled to keep an accurate account
of the hogs, pigs, and pieces of sandal wood, etc., at which each person was
taxed.</p>

<p>In Timor island, according to the Chinese records in 1618, the people had no writing.
When they wanted to record something they did it with flat stones, and a
thousand stones were represented by a string.</p>

<p>Knotted cords were originally used in Tibet, but we have no information about
their system of using them. The bare statement comes from the Chinese annals.</p></div>

<p>The following statement regarding the same use by the Chinese is
made by Ernest Faber (<i>a</i>). He says: “In the highest antiquity, government
was carried on successfully by the use of knotted cords to preserve
the memory of things. In subsequent ages, the sages substituted
for these written characters. By means of these the doings of all the
officers could be regulated and the affairs of all the people accurately
examined.”</p>


<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">NOTCHED OR MARKED STICKS.</span></h3>

<p>The use of notches for mere numeration was frequent, but there are
also instances of their special significance.</p>

<p>The Dakotas, Hidatsa, and Shoshoni have been observed to note the
number of days during which they journeyed from one place to another
by cutting lines or notches upon a stick.</p>

<p>The coup sticks carried by Dakota warriors often bear a number of
small notches, which refer to the number of the victims hit with the
stick after they had been wounded or killed.</p>

<p>The young men and boys of the several tribes at Fort Berthold,
Dakota, frequently carry a stick, upon which they cut a notch for every
bird killed during a single expedition.</p>

<p>In Seaver’s (<i>a</i>) life of Mary Jemison it is set forth that the war chief
in each tribe of Iroquois keeps a war-post, in order to commemorate
great events and preserve the chronology of them. This post is a
peeled stick of timber 10 or 12 feet high, and is erected in the village.
For a campaign they make, or rather the chief makes, a perpendicular
red mark about 3 inches long and half an inch wide. On the opposite
side from this, for a scalp taken, they make a red cross, thus
<img src="images/dp288_pg227a.png" class="inline_image" width="30" height="38" alt="Greek cross" />

On another side, for a prisoner taken alive, they make a red cross in
this manner
<img src="images/dp288_pg227b.png" class="inline_image" width="30" height="30" alt="saltire with dot" />
 with a head or dot, and by placing these significant
signs in so conspicuous a situation they are enabled to ascertain with
great certainty the time and circumstances of past events.</p>

<p>It is suggested that the device first mentioned represents the scalp
severed and lifted from the head, and that the second refers to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228">[228]</a></span>
manner in which the prisoners were secured at night,
pegged and tied in the style called spread-eagle.</p>

<p>Rev. Richard Taylor (<i>a</i>) notes that the Maori had
neither the quipus nor wampum, but only a board
shaped like a saw, which was called “he rakau
wakapa-paranga,” or genealogical board. It was,
in fact, a tally, having a notch for each name, and a
blank space to denote where the male line failed
and was succeeded by that of the female; youths
were taught their genealogies by repeating the
names of each ancestor to whom the notches referred.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the use by bakers of notched
sticks or tallies, as they are called, still exists in
some civilized regions, and there is an interesting
history connected with the same wooden tallies,
which until lately were used in the accounts of the
exchequer of Great Britain. They also appear more
recently and in a different use as the Khe-mou circulated
by Tartar chiefs to designate the number of
men and horses required to be furnished by each
camp.</p>


<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">WAMPUM.</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp291_pg228h.png">
<img src="images/dp291_pg228.png" class="hires" width="500" height="71" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 163.</span>&mdash;Wampum strings.</div>
</div>

<p>Prof. Robert E. C. Stearns (<i>a</i>) says that wampum
consisted of beads of two principal colors having a
cylindrical form, a quarter of an inch, more or less,
in length, the diameter or thickness being usually
about half the length. The color of the wampum
determined its value. The term wampum, wampon,
or wampom, and wampum-peege was apparently applied
to these beads when strung or otherwise connected,
fastened, or woven together. The illustration
given by him is now reproduced as Fig. 163.</p>

<p>In the Jesuit Relations, 1656, p. 3, the first present
of an Iroquois chief to Jesuit missionaries at a
council is described. This was a great figure of the
sun, made of 6,000 beads of wampum, which explained
to them that the darkness shall not influence
them in the councils and the sun shall enlighten them
even in the depth of night.</p>

<p>Among the Iroquoian and Algonquian tribes wampum
belts were generally used to record treaties.
Mr. John Long (<i>a</i>) describes one of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The wampum belts given to Sir William Johnson, of immortal
Indian memory, were in several rows, black on each
side and white in the middle; the white being placed in the
center was to express peace and that the path between them
was fair and open. In the center of the belt was a figure of
a diamond made of white wampum, which the Indians call the
council fire.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Jesuit Relations, 1642, p. 53, it is said that among the northern
Algonquins a present to deliver a prisoner consisted of three strings of
wampum to break the three bonds by which he was supposed to be
tied, one around the legs, one around the arms, and the third around
the middle.</p>

<p>In the same Relations, 1653, p. 19, is a good example of messages
attached to separate presents of wampum, etc. This was at a council
in 1653 at the Huron town, 2 leagues from Quebec:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first was given to dry the tears which are usually shed at the news of brave
warriors massacred in combat.</p>

<p>The second served as an agreeable drink, as an antidote to whatever bitterness
might remain in the heart of the French on account of the death of their people.</p>

<p>The third was to furnish a piece of bark or a covering for the dead, lest the sight
of them should renew the old strife.</p>

<p>The fourth was to inter them and to tread well the earth upon their graves, in
order that nothing should ever come forth from their tombs which could grieve their
friends and cause the spirit of revenge to arise in their minds.</p>

<p>The fifth was to serve as a wrapping to pack up the arms which were henceforth
not to be touched.</p>

<p>The sixth was to cleanse the river, soiled with so much blood.</p>

<p>The last, to exhort the Hurons to agree to what Onontio, the great captain of the
French, should decide upon touching the peace.</p></div>

<p>As a rule there was no intrinsic significance in a wampum belt, or
collar, as the French sometimes called it. It was not understood
except by the memory of those to whom and by whom it was delivered.
This is well expressed in a dialogue reported by Capt. de Lamothe
Cadillac (<i>a</i>) in 1703:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Council of Hurons at Fort Ponchartrain, June 3, 1703.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quarante-Sols.</span> I come on my way to tell you what I propose to do at Montreal.
Here is a collar which has been sent to us by the Iroquois, and which the Ottawas
have brought to us; we do not know what it signifies.</p>

<p>M. de <span class="smcap">Lamothe</span>. How have you received this collar without knowing the purpose
for which it was sent you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quarante-Sols.</span> It has already been long since we received it. I was not there,
and our old men have forgotten what it said.</p>

<p>M. de <span class="smcap">Lamothe</span>. Your old men are not regarded as children to have such a short
memory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quarante-Sols.</span> We do not accept this collar; but we are going to take it to
Sonnontouan [the Seneca town] to find out what it means; because it is a serious
matter not to respond to a collar; it is the custom among us. The Ottawas can tell
you what it is, because our people have forgotten it.</p>

<p>M. de <span class="smcap">Lamothe</span>. The Ottawas will reply that having received it you should
remember it, but since this collar is dumb and has lost its speech I am obliged to be
silent myself.</p></div>

<p>In the Diary of the Siege of Detroit (<i>a</i>) it is narrated that after receiving
a belt of wampum from the commanding officer the Pottawatomi
chief called it the officer’s “mouth,” and said that those to whom it
was sent would believe it when “they saw his mouth.”</p>

<p>But wampum designs, besides being mere credentials, and thus like
the Australian message sticks, and also mnemonic, became, to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230">[230]</a></span>
extent, conventional. The predominance
of white beads indicated peace, and purple
or violet meant war.</p>

<p>On the authority of Sir Daniel Wilson
(<i>a</i>) a string of black wampum sent round
the settlement is still among the Indians
of the Six Nations the notice of the death
of a chief.</p>

<p>The Iroquois belts had an arrangement
of wampum to signify the lakes, rivers,
mountains, valleys, portages, and falls
along the path of trail between them and
the Algonkins, who were parties to their
treaty in 1653.</p>

<p>On the authority of a manuscript letter
from St. Ange to D’Abbadie, September 9,
1764, quoted by Parkman (<i>a</i>), Pontiac’s
great wampum belt was 6 feet long, 4 inches
wide, and was wrought from end to end
with the symbols of tribes and villages, 47
in number, which were leagued with him.</p>

<p>In addition to becoming conventional
the designs in wampum, perhaps from expertness
in their workmanship, exhibited
ideographs in their later development, of
which the following description, taken
from Rev. Peter Jones’s (<i>a</i>), “History of
the Ojebway Indians” is an instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Johnson then explained the emblems contained
in the wampum belt brought by Yellowhead,
which, he said, they acknowledged to be the acts
of their fathers. Firstly, the council fire at the
Sault Ste. Marie has no emblem, because then the
council was held. Secondly, the council fire at
Mamtoulni has the emblem of a beautiful white
fish; this signifies purity, or a clean white heart&mdash;that
all our hearts ought to be white toward each
other. Thirdly, the emblem of a beaver, placed at
an island on Penetanguishew bay, denotes wisdom&mdash;that
all the acts of our fathers were done
in wisdom. Fourthly, the emblem of a white deer,
placed at Lake Simcoe, signified superiority; the
dish and ladles at the same place indicated abundance
of game and food. Fifthly, the eagle perched
on a tall pine tree at the Credit denotes watching,
and swiftness in conveying messages. The
eagle was to watch all the council fires between
the Six Nations and the Ojebways, and being far-sighted,
he might, in the event of anything happening,
communicate the tidings to the distant
tribes. Sixthly, the sun was hung up in the center
of the belt to show that their acts were done
in the face of the sun, by whom they swore that
they would forever after observe the treaties
made between the two parties.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same work, p. 119, is a description of a wampum belt that
recorded the first treaty between the Ojibwa and the Six Nations of
the Iroquois confederacy. It has the figure of a dish or bowl at its
middle to represent that the Ojibwa and the Six Nations were all to
eat out of the same dish, meaning, ideographically, that all the game
in the region should be for their common use.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 164.</span>&mdash;Penn wampum belt.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. W. H. Holmes (<i>c</i>) gives an illustration of the well-known Penn
wampum belt, reproduced here as Fig. 164, with remarks condensed as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is believed to be the original belt delivered by the Leni-Lenape sachems to
William Penn at the celebrated treaty under the elm tree at Schackamaxon in 1682.
Up to the year 1857 this belt remained in the keeping of the Penn family. In March,
1857, it was presented to the Pennsylvania Historical Society by Granville John
Penn, a great-grandson of William Penn. Mr. Penn, in his speech on this occasion,
states that there can be no doubt that this is the identical belt used at the treaty,
and presents his views in the following language:</p>

<p>“In the first place, its dimensions are greater than of those used on more ordinary
occasions, of which we have one still in our possession&mdash;this belt being composed of
18 strings of wampum, which is a proof that it was the record of some very important
negotiation. In the next place, in the center of the belt, which is of white
wampum, are delineated in dark-colored beads, in a rude, but graphic style, two
figures&mdash;that of an Indian grasping with the hand of friendship the hand of a man
evidently intended to be represented in the European costume wearing a hat, which
can only be interpreted as having reference to the treaty of peace and friendship
which was then concluded between William Penn and the Indians, and recorded by
them in their own simple but descriptive mode of expressing their meaning by the
employment of hieroglyphics.”</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 4.<br /><span class="subhead">ORDER OF SONGS.</span></h3>

<p>The Indian songs or, more accurately, chants, with which pictography
is connected, have been preserved in their integrity by the use of
pictured characters. They are in general connected with religious
ceremonies, and are chiefly used in the initiation of neophytes to secret
religious orders. Some of them, however, are used in social meetings
or ceremonies of cult societies, though the distinction between social or
any other general associations and those to be classified as religious is
not easily defined. Religion was the real life of the tribes, permeating
all their activities and institutions.</p>

<p>The words of these songs are invariable, even to the extent that by
their use for generations many of them have become archaic and form
no part of the colloquial language. Indeed, they are not always understood
by the best of the shaman songsters, which fact recalls the
oriental memorization of the Veda ritual through generations by the
priests, who thus, without intent, preserved a language. The sounds
were memorized, although the characters designating or, more correctly,
recalling them, were not representations of sound, but of idea.</p>

<p>Practically, the words&mdash;or sounds, understood or not, which passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232">[232]</a></span>
for words&mdash;as well as the notes, were memorized by the singers, and
their memory, or that of the shaman, who acted as leader or conductor
or precentor, was assisted by the charts. Exoteric interpretation of
any ideographic and not merely conventional or purely arbitrary characters
in the chart, which may be compared for indistinctness with the
translated libretto of operas, may suggest the general subject-matter,
perhaps the general course, of the chant, but can not indicate the exact
words, or, indeed, any words, of the language chanted.</p>

<p>A simple mode of explaining the amount of symbolism necessarily
contained in the charts of the order of songs is by likening them to the
illustrated songs and ballads lately published in popular magazines,
where every stanza has at least one appropriate illustration. Let it be
supposed that the text was obliterated forever, indeed, the art of reading
lost, the illustrations remaining, as also the memory to some persons
of the words of the ballad. The illustrations, kept in their original
order, would always supply the order of the stanzas and also the particular
subject-matter of each particular stanza, and that subject-matter
would be a reminder of the words. This is what the rolls of birchbark
supply to the initiated Ojibwa. Schoolcraft pretended that there is
intrinsic symbolism in the characters employed, which might imply
that the words of the chants were rather interpretations of those characters
than that the latter were reminders of the words. But only
after the vocables of the actual songs and chants have been learned
can the mnemonic characters be clearly understood. Doubtless the
more ideographic and the less arbitrary the characters the more readily
can they be learned and retained in the memory, and during the
long period of the practical use of the mnemonic devices many exhibiting
ideography and symbolism have been invented or selected.</p>

<div class="caption">BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY TENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XVII<br />ORDER OF SONGS&mdash;OJIBWA.</div>
</div>

<p>The ceremonial songs represented pictorially in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVII</span>, A, B, C,
and D, were obtained from Ojibwa shamans at White Earth, Minnesota,
by Dr. Hoffman, and pertain to the ceremony of initiating new
members into the Midē' wiwin or Grand Medicine Society. The language,
now omitted, differs to some extent from that now spoken. The
songs and ritual are transmitted from generation to generation, and
although an Indian who now receives admission into the society may
compose his own songs for use in connection with his profession, he
will not adopt the modern Ojibwa words, but employs the archaic whenever
practicable. To change the ancient forms would cause loss of
power in the charms which such songs are alleged to possess.</p>

<p>The translation of the songs was given by the Ojibwa singers, while
the remarks in smaller type further elucidate the meaning of the phrases,
as afterwards explained by the shaman.</p>

<p>The characters were all drawn upon birch bark, as is usual with the
“medicine songs” of the Ojibwa, and the words suggested by the incisions
were chanted. The incompleteness of some of the phrases was
accounted for by the shaman by the fact that they are gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233">[233]</a></span>
being forgotten. The ceremonies are now of infrequent occurrence, which
tends to substantiate this assertion.</p>

<p>One song, as presented on a single piece of birch bark, really consists
of as many songs as there are mnemonic characters. Each phrase, corresponding
to a character, is repeated a number of times; the greater
the number of repetitions the greater will be the power of inspiration
in the singer. One song or phrase may, therefore, extend over a
period of from two to ten or more minutes.</p>

<p>The song covers much more time when dancing accompanies it, as is
the case with the first one presented below. The dancing generally
commences after a pause, designated by a single vertical bar.</p>

<p>The following characters are taken from A, Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVII</span>, and are here

<p class="parallel">The Ojibwa chart, used in the “Song for the Metai, or for Medicine
Hunting,” is taken from Tanner’s (<i>a</i>) Narrative and reproduced in
Fig. 165. It should be noted that the Metai of Tanner’s interpretation,
which follows, is the same as the Midē' in the foregoing interpretations:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/dp316_pg247.png" width="465" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 165.</span>&mdash;Song for Medicine Hunting.</div>
</div>

<p><i>a</i>. Now I hear it, my friends of the Metai, who are sitting about me.</p>

<p>This and the three following are sung by the principal chief of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247">[247]</a></span>
Metai, to the beat of his bwoin ah-keek, or drum. The line from the
sides of the head of the figure indicate hearing.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Who makes this river flow? The Spirit, he makes this river flow.</p>

<p>The second figure is intended to represent a river, and a beaver
swimming down it.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Look at me well, my friends; examine me, and let us understand
that we are all companions.</p>

<p>This translation is by no means literal. The words express the
boastful claims of a man who sets himself up for the best and most
skillful in the fraternity.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Who maketh to walk about, the social people? A bird maketh
to walk about the social people.</p>

<p>By the bird the medicine man means himself; he says that his voice
has called the people together. Weej-huh nish-a-nauba, or weeja-nish-a-nau-ba
seems to have the first syllable from the verb which
means to accompany. The two lines drawn across, between this figure
and the next, indicate that here the dancing is to commence.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> I fly about and if anywhere I see an animal, I can shoot him.</p>

<p>This figure of a bird (probably an eagle or hawk) seems intended to
indicate the wakefulness of the senses and the activity required to insure
success in hunting. The figure of the moose which immediately
follows, reminding the singer of the cunning and extreme shyness of
that animal, the most difficult of all to kill.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> I shoot your heart; I hit your heart, oh, animal&mdash;your heart&mdash;I hit
your heart.</p>

<p>This apostrophe is mere boasting and is sung with much gesticulation
and grimace.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> I make myself look like fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a medicine man disguised in the skin of a bear. The small parallelogram
under the bear signifies fire, and the shamans, by some composition
of gunpowder, or other means, contrive to give the appearance
of fire to the mouth and eyes of the bear skin, in which they go about
the village late at night, bent on deeds of mischief, oftentimes of blood.
We learn how mischievous are these superstitions when we are informed
that they are the principal men of the Metai, who thus wander
about the villages in the disguise of a bear, to wreak their hatred on a
sleeping rival or their malice on an unsuspecting adversary. But the
customs of the Indians require of anyone who may see a medicine man
on one of these excursions to take his life immediately, and whoever
does so is accounted guiltless.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> I am able to call water from above, from beneath, and from around.</p>

<p>Here the medicine man boasts of his power over the elements, and
his ability to do injury or benefit. The segment of a circle with dots
in it represents water and the two short lines touching the head of the
figure indicate that he can draw it to him.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> I cause to look like the dead, a man I did.</p>

<p>I cause to look like the dead, a woman I did.</p>

<p>I cause to look like the dead, a child I did.</p>

<p>The lines drawn across the face of this figure indicate poverty, distress,
and sickness; the person is supposed to have suffered from the
displeasure of the medicine man. Such is the religion of the Indians.
Its boast is to put into the hands of the devout supernatural means
by which he may wreak vengeance on his enemies whether weak or
powerful, whether they be found among the foes of his tribe or the
people of his own village. This Metai, so much valued and revered by
them, seems to be only the instrument in the hands of the crafty for
keeping in subjection the weak and the credulous, which may readily
be supposed to be the greater part of the people.</p>

<p><i>k.</i> I am such, I am such, my friends; any animal, any animal, my
friends, I hit him right, my friends.</p>

<p>This boast of certain success in hunting is another method by which
he hopes to elevate himself in the estimation of his hearers. Having
told them he has the power to put them all to death, he goes on to speak
of his infallible success in hunting, which will always enable him to be
a valuable friend to such as are careful to secure his good will.</p>

<p>The following chart for the “Song for beaver hunting and the Metai,”
is taken from the same author, loc. cit., and reproduced in Fig. 166,
with interpretations as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/dp318_pg249.png" width="500" height="336" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 166.</span>&mdash;Song for beaver hunting.</div>
</div>

<p><i>a.</i> I sit down in the lodge of the Metai, the lodge of the Spirit.</p>

<p>This figure is intended to represent the area of the Metai-we-gaun, or
medicine lodge, which is called also the lodge of the Man'idō, and two
men have taken their seats in it. The matter of the song seems to be
merely introductory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p><i>b.</i> Two days must you sit fast, my friend; four days must you sit
fast, my friend.</p>

<p>The two perpendicular lines on the breast of this figure are read ne-o-gone
(two days), but are understood to mean two years; so of the
four lines drawn obliquely across the legs, these are four years. The
heart must be given to this business for two years, and the constrained
attitude of the legs indicates the rigid attention and serious consideration
which the subject requires.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Throw off, woman, thy garments, throw off.</p>

<p>The power of their medicines and the incantations of the Metai are
not confined in their effect to animals of the chase, to the lives and
health of men; they control also the minds of all and overcome the
modesty as well as the antipathies of women. The Indians firmly believe
that many a woman who has been unsuccessfully solicited by a
man is not only by the power of the Metai made to yield, but even in
a state of madness to tear off her garments and pursue after the man
she before despised. These charms have greater power than those in
the times of superstition among the English, ascribed to the fairies,
and they need not, like the plant used by Puck, be applied to the person
of the unfortunate being who is to be transformed; they operate at
a distance through the medium of the Miz-zin-ne-neens.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Who makes the people walk about? It is I that calls you.</p>

<p>This is in praise of the virtue of hospitality, that man being most
esteemed among them who most frequently calls his neighbors to his
feast.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Anything I can shoot with it (this medicine) even a dog, I can
kill with it.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> I shoot thy heart, man, thy heart.</p>

<p>He means, perhaps, a buck moose by the word e-nah-ne-wah, or man.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> I can kill a white loon, I can kill.</p>

<p>The white loon (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rara avis nigroque similimo cygno</span>) is certainly a rare
and most difficult bird to kill; so we may infer that this boaster can
kill anything, which is the amount of the meaning intended in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250">[250]</a></span>
part of his song recorded by the five last figures. Success in hunting
they look upon as a virtue of a higher character, if we may judge from
this song, than the patience under suffering or the rakishness among
women, or even the hospitality recommended in the former part.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> My friends&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There seems to be an attempt to delineate a man sitting with his
hands raised to address his friends; but the remainder of his speech
is not remembered. This is sufficient to show that the meaning of the
characters in this kind of picture writing is not well settled and requires
a traditional interpretation to render it intelligible.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> I open my wolf skin and the death struggle must follow.</p>

<p>This is a wolf skin used as a medicine bag and he boasts that whenever
he opens it something must die in consequence.</p>

<p>Tanner’s Narrative (<i>b</i>) says of musical notation drawn on bark by
Ojibwas:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Many of these songs are noted down by a method probably peculiar to the Indians,
on birch bark, or small flat pieces of wood: the ideas being conveyed by emblematic
figures, somewhat like those * * * used in communicating ordinary information.</p></div>

<p>Rev. P. J. De Smet (<i>a</i>) gives an account of the mnemonic order of
songs among the Kickapoo and Pottawatomi. He describes a stick 1&frac12;
inches broad and 8 or 10 long, upon which are arbitrary characters
which they follow with the finger in singing the prayers, etc. There
are five classes of these characters. The first represents the heart, the
second heart and flesh (chair), the third life, the fourth their names,
and the fifth their families.</p>

<p>A. W. Howitt (<i>b</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The makers of the Australian songs, or of the combined songs and dances are the
poets or bards of the tribe and are held in great esteem. Their names are known
to the neighboring peoples, and their songs are carried from tribe to tribe until the
very meaning of the words is lost as well as the original source of the song.</p>

<p>Such an instance is a song which was accompanied by a carved stick painted red,
which was held by the chief singer. This traveled down the Murray river from some
unknown source. The same song, accompanied by such a stick, also came into
Gippsland many years ago from Melbourne and may even have been the above mentioned
one on its return.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 5.<br />

<span class="subhead">TRADITIONS.</span></h3>

<p>Even since the Columbian discovery some tribes have employed
devices yet ruder than the rudest pictorial attempt as markers for the
memory. An account of one of these is given in E. Winslow’s Relation
(A. D. 1624), Col. Mass. Hist. Soc., 2d series, <span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span>, 1822, p. 99, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Instead of records and chronicles they take this course: Where any remarkable
act is done, in memory of it, either in the place or by some pathway near adjoining,
they make a round hole in the ground about a foot deep and as much over, which,
when others passing by behold, they inquire the cause and occasion of the same,
which, being once known, they are careful to acquaint all men as occasion serveth
therewith. And lest such holes should be filled or grown over by any accident, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251">[251]</a></span>
men pass by they will often renew the same, by which means many things of great
antiquity are fresh in memory. So that as a man traveleth, if he can understand his
guide, his journey will be the less tedious by reason of the many historical discourses
which will be related unto him.</p></div>

<p>In connection with this section students may usefully consult Dr. Brinton’s
(<i>f</i>) Lenâpé and their Legends.</p>

<p>As an example of a chart used in the exact repetition of traditions,
Fig. 167 is presented with the following explanation by Rev. J. Owen
Dorsey:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 196px;">
<a href="images/dp320_pg251h.png">
<img src="images/dp320_pg251.png" class="hires" width="196" height="500" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 167.</span>&mdash;Osage chart.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The chart accompanies a tradition chanted by members of a secret society of the
Osage tribe. It was drawn by an Osage, Red Corn.</p>

<p>The tree at the top represents the tree of life. By this flows a river. The tree
and the river are described later in the degrees.
When a woman is initiated she is required by the
head of her gens to take four sips of water (symbolizing
the river), then he rubs cedar on the palms
of his hands, with which he rubs her from head to
foot. If she belongs to a gens on the left side of a
tribal circle, her chief begins on the left side of her
head, making three passes, and pronouncing the
sacred name three times. Then he repeats the process
from her forehead down; then on the right side
of her head; then at the back of her head; four times
three times, or twelve passes in all.</p>

<p>Beneath the river are the following objects: The
Watse ʇuʞa, male slaying animal (?), or morning
star, which is a red star. 2. Six stars called the
“Elm rod” by the white people in the Indian territory.
3. The evening star. 4. The little star.
Beneath these are the moon, seven stars, and sun.
Under the seven stars are the peace pipe and war
hatchet; the latter is close to the sun, and the former
and the moon are on the same side of the chart.
Four parallel lines extending across the chart, represent
four heavens or upper worlds through which
the ancestors of the Tsiↄu people passed before they
came to this earth. The lowest heaven rests on an
oak tree; the ends of the others appear to be supported
by pillars or ladders. The tradition begins
below the lowest heaven, on the left side of the
chart, under the peace pipe. Each space on the
pillar corresponds with a line of the chant; and each
stanza (at the opening of the tradition) contains
four lines. The first stanza precedes the arrival of
the first heaven, pointing to a time when the children
of the “former end” of the race were without human bodies as well as human
souls. The bird hovering over the arch denotes an advance in the condition of the
people; then they had human souls in the bodies of birds. Then followed the progress
from the fourth to the first heaven, followed by the descent to earth. The
ascent to four heavens and the descent to three, makes up the number seven.</p>

<p>When they alighted, it was on a beautiful day when the earth was covered with
luxuriant vegetation. From that time the paths of the Osages separated; some
marched on the right, being the war gentes, while those on the left were peace
gentes, including the Tsiↄu, whose chart this is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Tsiↄu met the black bear, called in the tradition Káxe-wáhü-sa<sup>n</sup>' (Crow-bone-white),
in the distance. He offered to become their messenger, so they sent him
to the different stars for aid. According to the chart he went to them in the following
order: Morning star, sun, moon, seven stars, evening star, little star.</p>

<p>Then the black bear went to the Waↄiñʞa-ↄüʇse, a female red bird sitting on her
nest. This grandmother granted his request. She gave them human bodies, making
them out of her own body.</p>

<p>The earth lodge at the end of the chart denotes the village of the Hañʞa uta¢a<sup>n</sup>ʇsi,
who were a very warlike people. Buffalo skulls were on the tops of the lodges, and
the bones of the animals on which they subsisted whitened on the ground. The very
air was rendered offensive by the decaying bodies and offal.</p>

<p>The whole of the chart was used mnemonically. Parts of it, such as the four
heavens and ladders, were tattooed on the throat and chest of the old men belonging
to the order.</p></div>

<p>The tradition relating to Minabō'zho and the sacred objects received
from Kítshi Man'idō is illustrated in Fig. 168, which, represents a copy
(one-third original size) of the record preserved at White Earth. This
record is read from left to right and is, briefly, as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/dp321_pg252.png" width="500" height="118" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 168.</span>&mdash;Midē' record.</div>
</div>

<p><i>a</i> represents Minabō'zho, who says of the adjoining characters representing
the members of the Midéwin: “They are the ones, they are the
ones who put into my heart the life.” Minabō'zho holds in his left
hand the sacred medicine bag.</p>

<p><i>b</i> and <i>c</i> represent the drummers; at the sound of the drum everybody
rises and becomes inspired, because the Great Spirit is then present in
the lodge.</p>

<p><i>d</i> denotes that women also have the privilege of becoming members
of the Midéwin. This figure holds a snake-skin “medicine bag” in her
left hand.</p>

<p><i>e</i> represents the tortoise, the good spirit, who was the giver of some
of the sacred objects used in the rite.</p>

<p><i>f</i> the bear, also a benevolent spirit, but not held in so great veneration
as the tortoise. His tracks are visible in the lodge.</p>

<p><i>g</i> the sacred medicine bag, Biń-ji-gú-sân, which contains life and can
be used by the Midē' to prolong the life of a sick person.</p>

<p><i>h</i> represents a dog given by the spirits to Minabō'zho as a companion.</p>

<p>Fig. 169 gives copies, one-third actual size, of two records in possession
of different Midē' at Red lake. The characters are almost identical,
and one record appears to have been copied from the other. The lower
figure, however, contains an additional character. The following is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253">[253]</a></span>
incomplete interpretation of the characters, the letters applying equally
to both:</p>

of the Midéwin.</p>

<p><i>b</i>, the drum and drumsticks.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, a bar or rest, observed while chanting the words pertaining to the
records.</p>

<p><i>d</i>, the bin'-ji-gu'-sân, or sacred medicine bag. It consists of an otter
skin, and is the mī'gis, or sacred symbol of the midē'wigân' or grand
medicine lodge.</p>

<p><i>e</i>, a Midē' shaman, the one who holds the mī'gis while chanting the
Midē' song in the grand medicine lodge, <i>f</i>. He is inspired, as indicated
by the line extending from the heart to the mouth.</p>

<p><i>f</i>, representation of the grand medicine lodge. This character, with
slight addition, is usually employed by the southern division of the
Ojibwa to denote the lodge of a jĕssakkī'd, and is ordinarily termed a
“jugglery.”</p>

<p><i>g</i>, a woman, and signifies that women may also be admitted to the
midē'wigân', shown in the preceding character.</p>

<p><i>h</i>, a pause or rest in the chant.</p>

<p><i>i</i>, the sacred snake-skin bag, having the power of giving life through
its skin. This power is indicated by the lines radiating from the head
and the back of the snake.</p>

<p><i>j</i> represents a woman.</p>

<p><i>k</i>, another illustration of the mī'gis, represented by the sacred otter.</p>

<p><i>l</i> denotes a woman who is inspired, as shown by the line extending
from the heart to the mouth in the lower chart, and simply showing the
heart in the upper. In the latter she is also empowered to cure with
magic plants.</p>

<p><i>m</i> represents a Midē' shaman, but no explanation was obtained of the
special character delineated.</p>

<p>In Fig. 170 is presented a variant of the characters shown
in <i>a</i> of Fig. 169. The fact that this denotes the power to
cure by the use of plants would appear to indicate an older

rendering of the tradition.</p></div>

<p><i>g</i> is the drum used in the ceremony.</p>

<p><i>h</i> is an outline of the victim. A human figure is drawn upon a piece
of birchbark, over which the incantations are made, and, to insure
the death of the subject, a small spot of red paint is rubbed upon the

<p><i>i</i>, the outer line represents a lake, while the inner one is an island,
upon which the victim resides.</p>

<p>The ceremony indicated in the above description actually occurred at
White Earth during the autumn of 1884, and, by a coincidence, the Indian
“conjured” died the following spring of pneumonia resulting from
cold contracted during the winter. This was considered as the result
of the Midē'’s power, and naturally secured for him many new adherents
and believers.</p>

<h4>THE ORIGIN OF THE INDIANS.</h4>

<p>Sikas'sigé, one of the officiating priests of the Midē' society of the
Ojibwa at White Earth, Minnesota, gives the following explanation of
Fig. 173, which is a reduced copy of a pictorial representation of a tradition
explaining the origin of the Indians:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp325_pg256h.png">
<img src="images/dp325_pg256.png" class="hires" width="500" height="206" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 173.</span>&mdash;Origin of the Indians.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the beginning, Ki'tshi Man'idō&mdash;Dzhe Man'idō, <i>a</i>&mdash;made the Midē' Man'idōs.
He first created two men, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, and two women, <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>, but they had no power
of thought or reason. Then Dzhe Man'idō made them reasoning beings. He then
took them in his hands so that they should multiply; he paired them, and from this
sprung the Indians. Then, when there were people, he placed them upon the earth;
but he soon observed that they were subject to sickness, misery, and death, and
that unless he provided them with the sacred medicine they would soon become
extinct.</p>

<p>Between the position occupied by Dzhe Man'idō and the earth were four lesser
spirits, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, and <i>i</i>, with whom Dzhe Man'idō decided to commune, and to impart
the mysteries by which the Indians could be benefited; so he first spoke to a spirit
at <i>f</i>, and told him all he had to say, who in turn communicated the same information
to <i>g</i>, and he in turn to <i>h</i>, who also communed with <i>i</i>. Then they all met in council
and determined to call in the four wind gods at <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, and <i>m</i>. After consulting as
to what would be best for the comfort and welfare of the Indians, these spirits
agreed to ask Dzhe Man'idō to communicate the mystery of the sacred medicine to
the people.</p>

<p>Dzhe Man'idō then went to the Sun Spirit (<i>o</i>) and asked him to go to the earth and
instruct the people as had been decided upon by the council. The Sun Spirit, in the
form of a little boy, went to the earth and lived with a woman (<i>p</i>) who had a little
boy of her own.</p>

<p>This family went away in the autumn to hunt, and during the winter this woman’s
son died. The parents were so much distressed that they decided to return to the
village and bury the body there; so they made preparations to return, and as they
traveled along they would each evening erect several poles upon which the body
was placed to prevent the wild beasts from devouring it. When the dead boy was
thus hanging upon the poles the adopted child&mdash;who was the Sun Spirit&mdash;would
play about the camp and amuse himself, and finally told his adopted father he
pitied him, and his mother, for their sorrow. The adopted son said he could bring
his dead brother to life, whereupon the parents expressed great surprise and desired
to know how that could be accomplished.</p>

<p>The adopted boy then had the party hasten to the village, when he said, “Get the
women to make a wig'iwam of bark (<i>q</i>), put the dead boy in a covering of birch
bark and place the body on the ground in the middle of the wig'iwam.” On the
next morning, when this had been done, the family and friends went into this lodge
and seated themselves around the corpse.</p>

<p>After they had all been sitting quietly for some time they saw, through the doorway,
the approach of a bear (<i>r</i>), which gradually came toward the wig'iwam, entered
it, and placed itself before the dead body, and said hŭ', hŭ', hŭ', hŭ', when he passed
around it toward the left side, with a trembling motion, and as he did so the body
began quivering, which increased as the bear continued, until he had passed around
four times, when the body came to life and stood up. Then the bear called to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256">[256]</a></span>
father, who was sitting in the distant right-hand corner of the wig'iwam, and
addressed to him the following words:</p>

<p>
Nōs   | Ka-wi'-na | ni'-shi-nâ'-bi | wis'-si | a-ya'wi-an' | man'-i-do | nin-gi'-sis.<br />
My father |   is not    |     an Indian      |    not    |     you are     |  a spirit   |      son.<br />
<br />
Be-mai'-a-mi'-nik | ni'-dzhi | man'-i-do | mi'-a-zhi'-gwa | tshi-gi'-a-we-an'.<br />
Insomuch       | my fellow  |    spirit   |         now        |      as you are.<br />
<br />
Nōs   | a-zhi'-gwa | a-se'-ma | tshi-a'-to-yek'. | Â'-mi-kun'-dem | mi-e'-ta<br />
My father |     now      |   tobacco  |    you shall put.    |    He speaks of    |    only<br />
<br />
a-wi-dink' | dzhi-gŏsh'-kwi-tōt' | wen'-dzhi-bĭ-mâ'-di-zid'-o-ma' | a-ga'-wa<br />
once     |      to be able to do it      |          why he shall live here           |    now<br />
<br />
bi-mâ'-di-zid'-mi-o-ma'; | ni'-dzhi | man'-i-do | mi'-a-zhi'-gwa | tshi-gi'-we-an'.<br />
that he scarcely lives;     | my fellow  |   spirit    |   now I shall go   |        home.<br />
</p>

<p>The little bear boy (<i>r</i>) was the one who did this.
He then remained among the Indians (<i>s</i>) and
taught them the mysteries of the Grand Medicine
(<i>t</i>), and after he had finished he told his adopted
father that as his mission had been fulfilled, that
he was to return to his kindred spirits, the Indians
would have no need to fear sickness, as they now
possessed the Grand Medicine which would assist
them to live. He also said that his spirit could
bring a body to life but once, and he would now
return to the sun from which they would feel his
influence.</p>

<p>This is called Kwi'-wi-sĕns' wed-di'-shi-tshi'
ge'-wi-nĭp'&mdash;“Little boy, his work.”</p>

<p>From subsequent information it was learned
that the line (<i>w</i>) denotes the earth, and that,
being considered as one step in the course of initiation
into the Midē'wiwin, three others must be
taken before a candidate can be admitted. These
steps, or rests, as they are denominated, are typified
by four distinct gifts of goods, which must
be remitted to the Midē' priests before the ceremony
can take place.</p>

<p>The characters <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> are repetitions of the
figures alluded to in the tradition (<i>q</i> and <i>r</i>) to
signify that the candidate must personate the
Makwa' Man'idō&mdash;bear spirit&mdash;when entering the
Midē'wiwin (<i>t</i>); <i>t</i> is the Midē' Man'idō, as Ki'tshi
Man'idō is termed by the Midē' priests. The
device of horns, attached to the head, is a common
symbol of superior power, found in connection
with the figures of human and divine
forms in many Midē' songs and other mnemonic
records; <i>v</i> represents the earth’s surface, similar
to that designated as <i>w</i>. <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> represent the four degrees of the grand
medicine.</p></div>

<h3>SECTION 7.<br />

<span class="subhead">APPOINTMENT.</span></h3>

<p>Le Page Du Pratz (<i>b</i>) says in describing the council of conspiracy
which resulted in the Natchez war of 1729:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An aged councillor advised that after all the nations had been informed of the
necessity of taking this violent action, each one should receive a bundle of sticks,
all containing an equal number, and which were to mark the number of days to
pass before that on which they were all to strike at once; that in order to guard
against any mistake it would be necessary to take care to extract one stick every
day and to break it and throw it away; a man of wisdom should be charged with
this duty. All the old men approved of his advice and it was adopted.</p></div>

<p>Père Nicholas Perrot (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Celui qui, chez les Hurons, prenait la parole en cette circonstance, recevait un
petit faisceau de pailles d’pied de long qui luy servoient comme de jetons, pour supputer
les nombres et pour ayder la mémoire des assistans, les distribuant en divers
lots, suyvant la diversité des choses. Dans l’Amérique du Sud, les Galibis de la
rivière d’Amacourou et de l’Orénoque usaient du même procédé mnémotechnique, mais
perfectionné. Le capitaine [Galibis] et moy, écrit le P. la Pierre (Voyage en terre-ferme
et à la coste de Paria, p. 15 du Ms. orig.), eusmes un grand discours ... luy
ayant demandé ce qu’il alloit faire à Barime, il me respondit qu’il alloit avertir tous
les capitaines des aultres rivières, du jour qu’il en faudroit sortir pour aller donner
l’attaque à leurs ennemis. Et, pour me faire comprendre la façon dont il s’y prenoit
il me montra vingt petites buches liées ensemble qui se plient à la façon d’un rouleau.
Les six premières estoient d’une couleur particulière; elles signifioent que, les six
premiers jours, il falloit préparer du magnot [manioc] pour faire vivres. Les quatre
suivantes estoient d’une aultre couleur pour marque qu’il falloit avertir les hommes.
Les six d’aultre couleur et ainsi du reste, marquant par leur petites buches, faites
en façon de paille, l’ordre que chaque capitaine doit faire observer à ses gens pour
estre prest tous en mesme temps. La sortie devroit se faire dans vingt jours; car
il n’y avoit que cest [vingt] petites buches.</p></div>

<p>Im Thurn (<i>e</i>) tells of the Indians of Guiana as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When a paiwari feast is to be held, invitations are sent to the people of all neighboring
settlements inhabited by Indians of the same tribe as the givers of the feast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258">[258]</a></span>
The latter prepare a number of strings, each of which is knotted as many times as
there are days before the feast day. One of these strings is kept by the headman of
the settlement where the feast is to be held; the others are distributed, one to the
headman of each of the settlements from which guests are expected. Every day
one of the knots, on each of the strings, is untied, and when the last has been untied
guests and hosts know that the feast day has come.</p>

<p>Sometimes, instead of knots on a string, notches on a piece of wood are used.
This system of knot-tying, the quippoo system of the Peruvians, which occurs in
nearly identical form in all parts of the world, is not only used as in the above instance
for calendar-keeping, but also to record items of any sort; for instance, if
one Indian owes another a certain number of balls of cotton or other articles, debtor
and creditor each has a corresponding string or stick, with knots or notches to the
number of the owed article, and one or more of these is oblitered each time a payment
is made until the debt is wiped out.</p></div>

<p>Darius (Herodot. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV</span>, 98) did something of the kind when he took a
thong and, tying sixty knots in it, gave it to the Ionian chiefs, that they
might untie a knot every day and go back to their own land if he had
not returned when all the knots were undone.</p>

<p>Champlain (<i>a</i>) describes a mode of preparation for battle among the
Canadian Algonquins which partook of the nature of a military drill
as well as of an appointment of rank and order. It is in its essentials
mnemonic. He describes it as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les chefs prennent des bâtons de la longueur d’un pied autant en nombre qu’ils
sont et signalent par d’autres un peu plus grands, leurs chefs; puis vont dans le bois
et esplanadent une place de cinq ou six pieds en quarré où le chef comme Sergent
Major, met par ordre tous ces bâtons comme bon luy semble; puis appelle tous ses
compagnons, qui viennent tous armez, et leur monstre le rang et ordre qu’ils deuvont
tenir lors qu’ils se battront avec leurs ennemis.</p></div>

<p>The author adds detail with regard to alignment, breaking ranks,
and resumption of array.</p>


<h3>SECTION 8.<br />

<span class="subhead">NUMERATION.</span></h3>

<p>D. W. Eakins, in Schoolcraft I, p. 273, describes the mnemonic numeration
marks of the Muskoki thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Each perpendicular stroke stood for one, and each additional stroke marked an
additional number. The ages of deceased persons or number of scalps taken by
them, or war-parties which they have headed, are recorded on their grave-posts by
this system of strokes. The sign of the cross represents ten. The dot and comma
never stood as a sign for a day, or a moon, or a month, or a year. The chronological
marks that were and are in present use are a small number of sticks made generally
of cane. Another plan sometimes in use was to make small holes in a board,
in which a peg was inserted to keep the days of the week.</p></div>

<p>Capt. Bourke (<i>b</i>) gives the following account of an attempt at compromise
between the aboriginal method of numbering days, weeks, and
months, and that of the civilized intruders to whose system the Indians
found it necessary to conform.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Apache scouts kept records of the time of their absence on campaign. There
were several methods in vogue, the best being that of colored beads which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259">[259]</a></span>
strung on a string, six white ones to represent the days of the week, and one black, or
other color, to stand for Sundays. This method gave rise to some confusion, because
the Indians had been told that there were four weeks, or Sundays (“Domingos”), in
each “Luna,” or moon, and yet they soon found that their own method of determining
time by the appearance of the crescent moon was much the more satisfactory. Among
the Zuñi I have seen little tally sticks with the marks for the days and months incised
on the narrow edges, and among the Apache another method of indicating the
flight of time by marking on a piece of paper along a horizontal line a number of
circles or of straight lines across the horizontal datum line to represent the full days
which had passed, a heavy straight line for each Sunday, and a small crescent for
the beginning of each month.</p></div>

<p>It is not necessary to discuss the obvious method of repeating strokes,
dots, knots, human heads or forms, weapons, and totemic designs, to
designate the number of persons or articles referred to in the pictographs
where they appear.</p>


<h3>SECTION 9.<br />

<span class="subhead">ACCOUNTING.</span></h3>

<p>The Abnaki, in especial the Passamaquoddy division of the tribe in
Maine, during late years have been engaged in civilized industries in
which they have found it necessary to keep accounts. These are interesting
as exhibiting the aboriginal use of ideographic devices which
are only partially supplemented by the imitation of the symbols peculiar
to European civilization. Several of these devices were procured
by the present writer in 1888, and are illustrated and explained as follows:</p>

<p>A deer hunter brings 3 deerskins, for which he is allowed $2 each,
making $6; 30 pounds of venison, at 10 cents per pound, making $3.
In payment thereof he purchases 3 pounds of powder, at 40 cents per
pound; 5 pounds of pork, at 10 cents per pound; and 2 gallons of molasses,
at 50 cents per gallon. The debit foots $3.30, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260">[260]</a></span>
Indian account, but it seems on calculation to be 30 cents in excess, an
overcharge, showing the advance in civilization of the Passamaquoddy
trader.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/dp328_pg259.png" width="500" height="273" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 175.</span>&mdash;Shop account.</div>
</div>

<p>The following explanation will serve to make intelligible the characters
employed, which are reproduced in Fig. 175. The hunter is
shown as the first character in line <i>a</i>, and that he is a deer-hunter is
furthermore indicated by his having a skin-stretcher upon his back, as
well as the figure of a deer at which he is shooting. The three skins
referred to are shown stretched upon frames in line <i>b</i>, the total number
being also indicated by the three vertical strokes, between which
and the drying frames are two circles, each with a line across it, to denote
dollars, the total sum of $6 being the last group of dollar marks
on line <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The 30 pounds of venison are represented in line <i>c</i>, the three crosses
signifying 30, the T-shaped character designating a balance scale,
synonymous with pound, while the venison is indicated by the drawing
of the hind quarter or ham. The price is given by uniting the X, or
numeral, and the T, or pound mark, making a total of $3 as completing
the line <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>The line <i>d</i> refers to the purchase of 3 pounds of powder, as expressed
by the three strokes, the T, or scale for pound, and the powder horn, the
price of which is four Xs or 40 cents per pound, or T; and 3 pounds of
powder, the next three vertical strokes succeeded by a number of spots
to indicate grains of powder, which is noted as being 10 cents per
pound, indicated by the cross and T, respectively. The next item,
shown on line <i>e</i>, charges for 5 pounds of pork, the latter being indicated
by the outline of a pig, the price being indicated by the X or 10,
and T, scale or pound; then two short lines preceding one small oblong
square or quart measure, indicates that 2 quarts of molasses, shown by
the black spot, cost 5 crosses, or 50 cents per measure, the sum of the
whole of the purchase being indicated by three rings with stems and
three crosses, equivalent to $3.30.</p>

<p>Another Indian, whose occupation was to furnish basket wood,
brought some to the trader for which he received credit to the amount
of $1.15, taking in exchange therefor pork sufficient to equal the above
amount.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/dp329_pg260.png" width="400" height="153" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 176.</span>&mdash;Shop account.</div>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 176 the Indian is shown with a bundle of basket wood, the
value of which is given in the next characters, consisting of a ring with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261">[261]</a></span>
a line across to denote $1, a cross to represent 10 cents, and the five short
vertical lines for an additional 5 cents, making a total of $1.15. The
pork received from the trader is indicated by the outline of a pig, while
the crossed lines to the right denotes that the “account” is canceled.</p>

<p>Another customer, as shown in Fig. 177, was an old woman, the
descendent of an ancient name&mdash;one known before the coming of white
people. She was therefore called the “Owl,” and is represented in the
“account” given below. She had bought on credit 1 plug of smoking
tobacco, designated by one vertical stroke for the quantity and an oblong
square figure corresponding to the shape of the package, which was to
be used for smoking, as indicated by the spiral lines to denote smoke.
She had also purchased 2 quarts of kerosene oil, the quantity designated
by the two strokes preceding the small squares to represent quart
measures, and the liquid is indicated by the rude outline of a kerosene
lamp. This is followed by two crosses, representing 20 cents, as the
value of the amount of her purchases. This account was settled by
giving one basket, as shown in the device nearly beneath the owl, half
of which is marked with crossed lines, connected by a line of dots or
dashes with the cancellation mark at the extreme right of the record.</p>

</div>

<p>Another Passamaquoddy Indian, unable to read or write, carries on
business and keeps his books according to a method of his own invention.
One account is reproduced in Fig. 178. It is with a very slim
Indian, as will be observed from the drawing, who carries on “trucking”
and owns a horse, that animal being represented in outline and
connected by lines with its owner. For services he was paid $5.45,
which sum is shown in the lower line of characters by five dollar-marks&mdash;i. e.,
rings with strokes across them&mdash;4 crosses or numerals signifying 10
cents each, and five short vertical lines for 5 cents. The date is shown in
the upper line of characters, the 4 short lines in front of the horse signifying
4, the oval figure next, to the right and intended for a circle, denoting
the moon&mdash;i. e., the fourth moon, or April&mdash;while the 10 short
strokes signify the tenth day of the month&mdash;i. e., he was paid $5.45 in
full for services to April 10.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/dp331_pg262b.png" width="271" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 179.</span>&mdash;Book account.</div>
</div>

<p>Another account was with a young woman noted as very slim, and
is shown in Fig. 179. The girl brought a basket to the store, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262">[262]</a></span>
she was allowed 20 cents. She received credit for 10 cents on account
of a plug of tobacco bought some time previously.</p>

<p>In the illustration the decidedly slim form of the girl is portrayed,
her hands holding out the basket which she had made. The unattached
cross signifies 10 cents, which she probably received in cash, while the
other cross is connected by a dotted line with the piece of plug tobacco
for which she had owed 10 cents. The attachment of the plug to the
unpaid dime is amusingly ideographic.</p>

<p>Another Indian, descended from the prehistoric
Indians, was called “Lox,” the evil or tricksy deity,
appearing as an animal having a long body and tail
and short legs, which is probably a wolverine, under
which form Lox is generally depicted by the Passamaquoddy.
His account with the trader is given in
Fig. 180, and shows that he brought 1 dozen ax
handles, for which he received $1.50.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 501px;">
<img src="images/dp331_pg262c.png" width="501" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 180.</span>&mdash;Book account.</div>
</div>

<p>Beneath the figure of Lox are 2 axes, the 12 short
lines denoting the number of handles delivered, while
the dotted line to the right connects them with the
amount received, which is designated by 1 one dollar mark and 5
crosses or dime marks.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoffman found in Los Angeles,
California, a number of notched sticks,
which had been invented and used by
the Indians at the Mission of San
Gabriel. They had chief herders, who
had under their charge overseers of
the several classes of laborers, herders,
etc. The chief herder was supplied
with a stick of hard wood, measuring
about 1 inch in breadth and thickness
and from 20 to 24 inches long.
The corners were beveled at the handle. The general form of the stick
is given in the upper character of Fig. 181, with the exception that
the illustration is intentionally shortened so as to show both ends.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/dp332_pg263.png" width="500" height="199" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 181.</span>&mdash;Notched sticks.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon each of the beveled surfaces on the handle are marks to indicate
the kind of horned cattle referred to. The cross indicates that
the corner of the stick upon which it is incised relates to heifers, each
notch designating one head, the long transverse cut denoting ten, with
an additional three cuts signifying that the herder has in charge thirteen
heifers. Upon the next beveled edge appears an arrow-pointed
mark, to denote in like manner which edge of the stick is to be notched
for indicating the oxen. Upon the third beveled surface is one transverse
cut for the record of the number of bulls in the herd, while upon
the fourth bevel of the handle are two notches to note the number of
cows.</p>

<p>The stick is notched at the end opposite the handle to signify that
it refers only to horned cattle. That used to designate horses is sharpened
from two sides only, so that the end is wedge-shaped, or exactly
the reverse of the one first mentioned. The marks upon the handle
would be the same, however, with this exception&mdash;that one cut would
mean a stallion, two cuts a mare, the cross a gelding, and the arrow-shaped
figure a colt. Sticks were also marked to denote the several
kinds of stock and to record those which had been branded.</p>

<p>Another class of sticks were also used by the overseers, copies of
which were likewise preserved by the laborers and herders, to keep an
account of the number of days on which labor was performed, and to
record the sums of money received by the workman.</p>

<p>The lower character of Fig. 181 represents a stick, upon the beveled
edge of the handle of which is a cross to denote work. The short
notches upon the corner of the stick denote days, each seventh day or
week being designated by a cut extending across the stick.</p>

<p>Upon the opposite side of the handle is a circle or a circle with a
cross within it to denote the number of reals paid, each real being indicated
upon the edge of the stick by a notch, while each ten reals or
peso is noted by making the cut all the way across that face of the
stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Dall (<i>a</i>) says that the Innuit frequently keep accounts by tying
knots in a string or notching a stick. Capt. Bourke (<i>c</i>) reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Mexican state of Sonora I was shown, some twenty years ago, a piece of
buckskin, upon which certain Opata or Yaqui Indians&mdash;I forget exactly which tribe,
but it matters very little, as they are both industrious and honest&mdash;had kept account
of the days of their labor. There was a horizontal datum line as before, with complete
circles to indicate full days and half circles to indicate half days, a long heavy
black line for Sundays and holidays, and a crescent moon for each new month.
These accounts had to be drawn up by the overseer or superintendent of the rancho
at which the Indians were employed before the latter left for home each night.</p></div>

<p>Terrien de Lacouperie (<i>e</i>) says of the Sonthals of Bengal:</p>

<p>Their accounts are either notches on a stick, like those formerly used by the rustics
for keeping scores at cricket matches in country villages in England, or knots
on a piece of grass string, or a number of bits of straw tied together. I well remember
my astonishment while trying my first case between a grasping Mahajun and a
Sonthal when I ordered them to produce their accounts. * * * The Sonthal produced
from his back hair, where it had been kept, I suppose, for ornament, a dirty
bit of knotted grass string and threw it on the table, requesting the court to count
that, as it had got too long for him. Each knot represented a rupee, a longer space
between two knots represented the lapse of a year.</p></div>

<p>Many modes of accounting in a pictorial manner are noted in Europe
and America among people classed as civilized. Some of these are very
curious, but want of space prevents their recital here. A valuable
description of the survival of the system in Brittany is given by M.
Armand Landrin (<i>a</i>), translated and condensed as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the department of Finisterre the farmers, in keeping accounts, made bags of
their old socks and coat sleeves, of different colors, each color representing one of
the divisions of farm outlay or receipt, as cows, butter, milk, and corn. Each amount
received was placed in coin in the appropriate bag. When any coins were taken
out the same number of small stones or of peas or beans was put in to replace the
coins. Other farmers substituted for the bags small sticks of different length and
thickness in which they made cuts representing the receipts.</p>

<p>In the accounts with the laborers and farm hands the women were designated by
the triangle, intended to represent the Breton head dress <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">á grandes barbes</i>. The
kind of work performed was expressed by the tool connected with it, <i>e. g.</i>, a horseshoe
denoted the blacksmith, a scythe the mower, an ax the carpenter, a saddle the
harness-maker, and a tub the cooper. The bill of a veterinary surgeon was rendered
by drawing the figures of the several animals treated united in one group by a line.</p></div>

<p>Until quite recently the important accounts of the British exchequer
were kept by wooden tallies, and some bakers in the United States yet
persevere in keeping their accounts with their customers by duplicate
tallies, one of which is rendered as a bill and is verified by the other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="subhead">CHRONOLOGY.</span></h2>


<p>It is not within the scope of the present work to examine the several
systems of chronology of the American Indians, but only those pictorially
exhibited. The Mexican system, much more scientific and
more elaborate than that employed by the northern tribes, resembled
it in the graphic record or detail of exhibit, and is highly interesting
as compared with the Dakota Winter Counts. Although the principle
of designating the years was wholly different, the mode of that designation
was often similar, as is shown by collating the Codex Vaticanus
and the Codex Telleriano Remensis with the Winter Counts of Lone
Dog and Battiste Good, infra. It is also desirable to note the remarks
of Prof. Brinton (<i>e</i>) with regard to the Chilan Balam. At the close
of each of the Maya larger divisions of time (the so-called “Katum”), a
“chilan” or inspired diviner uttered a prediction of the character of
the year or epoch which was about to begin. This prophetic designation
of the year was like a Zadkiel’s almanac, while the Dakotan method
was a selection of the most important events of the past.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">TIME.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. William H. Corbusier, surgeon, U. S. Army, gives the following

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Dakotas make use of the circle as the symbol of a cycle of time; a small one
for a year and a large one for a longer period of time, as a life time, one old man.
Also a round of lodges or a cycle of seventy years, as in Battiste Good’s Winter
Count. The continuance of time is sometimes indicated by a line extending in a direction
from right to left across the page when on paper, and the annual circles are
suspended from the line at regular intervals by short lines, as in Fig. 182, upper
character, and the ideograph for the year is placed beneath each one. At other times
the line is not continuous, but is interrupted at regular intervals by the yearly circle,
as in the lower character of Fig. 182.</p></div>

<p>Under other headings in this paper are presented graphic expressions

<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">WINTER COUNTS.</span></h3>

<p>In the preliminary paper on “Pictographs of the North American
Indians,” published in the Fourth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology,
58 pages of text and 46 full-page plates were devoted to the
winter counts of the Dakota Indians. The minute detail of explanation,
the systematic comparison, and the synoptic presentation which
seemed to be necessary need not now be repeated to establish the genuine
character of the invention. This consisted in the use of events,
which were in some degree historical, to form a system of chronology.
The record of the events was only the device by which was accomplished
the continuous designation of years, in the form of charts
corresponding in part with the orderly arrangement of divisions of
time termed calendars. It was first made public by the present writer
in a paper entitled “A Calendar of the Dakota Nation,” which was
issued in April, 1877, in Bulletin III, No. I, of the United States Geological
and Geographical Survey. The title is now changed to that
adopted by the Dakotas themselves, viz, Winter Counts&mdash;in the original,
wan'iyetu wo'wapi.</p>

<p>The lithographed chart published with that paper, substantially the
same as Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XX</span>, Lone-Dog’s Winter Count, now much better presented
than ever before, is the winter count used by, or at least known to, a
large portion of the Dakota people, extending over the seventy-one
years commencing with the winter of A. D. 1800-’01.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp336e_pg266p3h.jpg">

<div class="caption">BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY TENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XX<br />LONE DOG’S WINTER COUNT.</div>
</div>

<p>The copy from which the lithograph was taken is traced on a strip
of cotton cloth, in size 1 yard square, which the characters almost
entirely fill, and is painted in two colors, black and red, used in the
original, of which it is a facsimile. The plate is a representation of
the chart as it would appear on the buffalo robe. It was photographed
from the copy on linen cloth, and not directly from the buffalo robe.
It was painted on the robe by Lone-Dog, an Indian belonging to the
Yanktonais tribe of the Dakotas, who in the autumn of 1876 was near
Fort Peck, Montana. His Dakota name is given in the ordinary English
literation as Shunka-ishnala, which words correspond nearly with
the vocables in Riggs’s lexicon for dog-lone. Lone-Dog claimed that,
with the counsel of the old men of his tribe, he decided upon some event
or circumstance which should distinguish each year as it passed, and
marked what was considered to be its appropriate symbol or device
upon a buffalo robe kept for the purpose. The robe was at convenient
times exhibited to other Indians of the tribe, who were thus taught the
meaning and use of the signs as designating the several years.</p>

<p>It is not, however, supposed that Lone-Dog was of sufficient age in the
year 1800 to enter upon the work. Either there was a predecessor from
whom he received the earlier records or, when he had reached manhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267">[267]</a></span>
he gathered the traditions from his elders and worked back, the
object either then or before being to establish some system of chronology
for the use of the tribe or more probably in the first instance for
the use of his own band.</p>

<p>Present knowledge of the winter-count systems shows that Lone-Dog
was not their originator. They were started, at the latest, before the
present generation, and have been kept up by a number of independent
recorders. The idea was one specially appropriate to the Indian
genius, yet the peculiar mode of record was an invention, and it is not
probably a very old invention, as it has not been used beyond a definite
district and people. If an invention of that character had been of
great antiquity it would probably have spread by intertribal channels
beyond the bands or tribes of the Dakota, where alone the copies of
such charts have been found and are understood.</p>

<p>The fact that Lone-Dog’s Winter Count, the only one known at the
time of its first publication, begins at a date nearly coinciding with
the first year of the present century, as it is called in the arbitrary computation
that prevails among most of the civilized peoples, awakened
a suspicion that it might be due to civilized intercourse and was not a
mere coincidence. If the influence of missionaries or traders started
any plan of chronology, it is remarkable that they did not suggest one
in some manner resembling the system so long and widely used, and
the only one they knew, of counting the numbers from an era, such as
the birth of Christ, the Hegira, the Ab Urbe Conditâ, or the first Olympiad.
But the chart shows nothing of this nature. The earliest character
merely represents the killing of a small number of Dakotas by
their enemies, an event neither so important nor interesting as many
others of the seventy-one shown in the chart, more than one of which,
indeed, might well have been selected as a notable fixed point before
and after which simple arithmetical notation could have been used to
mark the years. Instead of any plan that civilized advisers would
naturally have introduced, the one actually adopted was to individualize
each year by a specific recorded symbol. The ideographic record,
being preserved and understood by many, could be used and referred
to with ease and accuracy. Definite signs for the first appearance of
the smallpox and for the first capture of wild horses were dates as
satisfactory to the Dakota as the corresponding expressions A. D.
1802 and 1813 are to the Christian world, and far more certain than the
chronology expressed in terms of A. M. and B. C. The arrangement of
separate characters in an outward spiral starting from a central point
is a clever expedient to dispense with the use of numbers for noting
the years, yet allowing every date to be determined by counting backward
or forward from any other known. The whole conception seems
one strongly characteristic of the Indians, who in other instances have
shown such expertness in ideography. The discovery of several other
charts, which differ in their times of commencement and ending from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268">[268]</a></span>
that of Lone-Dog and from each other, removed any inference arising
from the above-mentioned coincidence in beginning with the present
century. The following copies of charts, substantially the same as that
of Lone-Dog, are now or have been in the possession of the present
writer:</p>

<p>1. A chart made and kept by Bo-i'-de, The-Flame, a Dakota, who, in
1877, lived near Fort Sully, Dakota.</p>

<p>The facsimile copy is on a cotton cloth about a yard square and in
black and red, thus far similar to the copy of Lone-Dog’s chart, but
the arrangement is different. The character for the first year mentioned
appears in the lower left-hand corner, and the record proceeds
toward the right to the extremity of the cloth, then crossing toward
the left and again toward the right at the edge of the cloth, and so
throughout, in the style called boustrophedon. It thus answers the
same purpose of orderly arrangement, allowing constant additions, like
the more circular spiral of Lone-Dog. This record is for the years
1786-’87 to 1876-’77, thus commencing earlier and ending later than
that of Lone-Dog.</p>

<p>2. A Minneconjou chief, The-Swan, kept another record on the dressed
skin of an antelope or deer, claiming that it had been preserved in his
family for seventy years.</p>

<p>The characters are arranged in a spiral similar to those in Lone-Dog’s
chart, but more oblong in form. The course of the spiral is from left
to right, not from right to left.</p>

<p>3. Another chart was kindly loaned to the writer by Bvt. Maj.
Joseph Bush, captain Twenty-second U. S. Infantry. It was procured
by him, in 1870 at the Cheyenne Agency. This copy is one yard by
three-fourths of a yard, spiral, beginning in the center, from right to
left. The figures are substantially the same as those in Lone-Dog’s
chart, with which it coincides in time, except that it ends at 1869-’70,
but the interpretation differs from that accompanying the latter in a
few particulars.</p>

<p>4. The chart of Mato Sapa, Black-Bear. He was a Minneconjou
warrior, residing in 1868 and 1869 on the Cheyenne Agency reservation,
on the Missouri river, near the mouth of the Cheyenne river.</p>

<p>This copy is on a smaller scale than that of Lone-Dog, being a flat
and elongated spiral, 2 feet 6 inches by 1 foot 6 inches. The spiral
reads from right to left. This chart, which begins like that of Lone-Dog,
ends with the years 1868-’69.</p>

<p>5. A most important and interesting Winter Count is that made by
Battiste Good, a Brulé Dakota, which was kindly contributed by Dr.
William H. Corbusier, surgeon U. S. Army. It begins with peculiar
cyclic devices from the year A. D. 900, and in thirteen figures embraces
the time to A. D. 1700, all these devices being connected with myths,
and some of them showing European influence. From 1700-’01 to
1879-’80 a separate character is given for each year, with its interpretation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269">[269]</a></span>
in much the same style as shown in the other charts mentioned.
Several Indians and half-breeds said that this count formerly embraced
about the same number of years as the others, but that Battiste Good
gathered the names of many years from the old people and placed
them in chronological order as far back as he was able to learn them.</p>

<p>Another Winter Count, communicated by Dr. Corbusier, is that in
the possession of American-Horse, an Oglala Dakota, at the Pine
Ridge agency in 1879, who asserted that his grandfather began it, and
that it is the production of his grandfather, his father, and himself.</p>

<p>A third Winter Count is communicated by Dr. Corbusier as kept
by Cloud-Shield. He was also an Oglala Dakota, at the Pine Ridge
agency, but of a different band from American-Horse. The last two
counts embrace nearly the same number of years, viz, from A. D. 1775
to 1878. Two dates belong to each figure, as a Dakota year covers a
portion of two of the calendar years common to civilization.</p>

<p>Dr. Corbusier also saw copies of a fourth Winter Count, which was
kept by White-Cow-Killer, at the Pine Ridge agency. He did not obtain
a copy of it, but learned most of the names given to the winters.</p>

<p>With reference to all the Winter Counts and to the above remarks
that a Dakota year covers a portion of two calendar years, the following
explanation may be necessary: The Dakota count their years by
winters (which is quite natural, that season in their high levels and latitudes
practically lasting more than six months), and say a man is so
many snows old, or that so many snow seasons have passed since an
occurrence. They have no division of time into weeks, and their months
are absolutely lunar, only twelve, however, being designated, which
receive their names upon the recurrence of some prominent physical
phenomenon. For example, the period partly embraced by February is
called the “raccoon moon;” March, the “sore-eye moon;” and April, that
“in which the geese lay eggs.” As the appearance of raccoons after
hibernation, the causes inducing inflamed eyes, and oviposition by geese
vary with the meteorological character of each year, and as the twelve
lunations reckoned do not bring back the point in the season when
counting commenced, there is often dispute in the Dakota tipis toward
the end of winter as to the correct current date. In careful examination
of the several counts it often is left in doubt whether the event
occurred in the winter months or was selected in the months immediately
before or in those immediately after the winter. No regularity
or accuracy is noticed in these particulars.</p>

<p>In considering the extent to which Lone-Dog’s chart is understood
and used, it may be mentioned that every intelligent Dakota of full
years to whom the writer has shown it has known what it meant, and
many of them knew a large part of the years portrayed. When there
was less knowledge, there was the amount that may be likened to that
of an uneducated person or a child who is examined about a map of the
United States, which had been shown to him before, with some explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270">[270]</a></span>
only partially apprehended or remembered. He would tell that
it was a map of the United States; would probably be able to point out
with some accuracy the state or city where he lived; perhaps the capital
of the country; probably the names of the states of peculiar position
or shape, such as Maine, Delaware, or Florida. So the Indian
examined would often point out in Lone-Dog’s chart the year in which
he was born, or that in which his father died, or in which there was
some occurrence that had strongly impressed him, but which had no
relation whatever to the significance of the character for the year in
question. It had been pointed out to him before, and he had remembered
it, while forgetting the remainder of the chart.</p>

<p>On comparing all the Winter Counts it is found that they often correspond,
but sometimes differ. In a few instances the differences are in
the succession of events, but they are usually due to an omission or to
the selection of another event. When a year has the same name in all
of them, the bands were probably encamped together, or else the event
fixed upon was of general interest; and when the name is different
the bands were scattered, or nothing of general interest occurred.
Many of the recent events are fresh in the memory of the people, as
the warriors who strive to make their exploits a part of the tribal traditions
proclaim them on all occasions of ceremony, count their coups,
as the performance is called. Declarations of this kind partake of the
nature of affirmations made in the invoked presence of a supposed
divinity. War shirts, on which scores of the enemies killed are kept,
and which are carefully transmitted from generation to generation,
help to refresh their memories in regard to some of the events.</p>

<p>The study of all the charts renders plain some points remaining in
doubt while the Lone-Dog chart was the only example known. It became
clear that there was no fixed or uniform mode of exhibiting the
order of continuity of the year-characters. They were arranged spirally
or lineally, or in serpentine curves, by boustrophedon or direct, starting
backward from the last year shown or proceeding uniformly forward
from the first year selected or remembered. Any mode that
would accomplish the object of continuity with the means of regular
addition seemed equally acceptable. So a theory advanced that there
was some symbolism in the right-to-left circling of Lone-Dog’s chart
was abandoned, especially when an obvious reproduction of that very
chart was made by an Indian with the spiral reversed. It was also
obvious that when copies were made, some of them probably from
memory, there was no attempt at Chinese accuracy. It was enough to
give the graphic or ideographic character, and frequently the character
is better defined on one of the charts than on the others for the corresponding
year. One interpretation would often throw light on the
others. It also appeared that, while different events were selected by
the recorders of the different systems, there was sometimes a selection
of the same event for the same year and sometimes for the next, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271">[271]</a></span>
as would be natural in the progress of a famine or epidemic, or as an
event gradually became known over a vast territory.</p>

<p>A test of the mode of selecting events for designating the Winter
Counts may be found in a suggestion made by the present writer in his
account of Lone-Dog’s chart, published in 1877, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The year 1876 has furnished good store of events for the recorder’s choice, and it
will be interesting to learn whether he has selected as the distinguishing event the
victory over Custer, or, as of still greater interest, the general seizure of ponies,
whereat the tribes, imitating Rachel, weep and will not be comforted, because they
are not.</p></div>

<p>It now appears that two of the Counts made for 1876 and observed
by the writer several years later have selected the event of the seizure
of the ponies, and that none of them make any allusion to the defeat of
Custer.</p>

<p>After examination of all the charts it is obvious that the design is not
narrative, that the noting of events is being subordinated to the marking
of the years by them, and that the pictographic serial arrangements
of sometimes trivial though generally notorious incidents having been
selected with special adaptation for use as a calendar. That in a few
instances small personal events, such as the birth of the recorder or the
death of members of his family, are set forth, may be regarded as interpolations
in or unauthorized additions to the charts. If they had exhibited
a complete national or tribal history for the years embraced in
them, their discovery would have been in some respects more valuable,
but they are interesting to anthropologists because they show an attempt
before unsuspected among the northern tribes of American
Indians to form a system of chronology.</p>

<p>While, as before mentioned, it is not now necessary to recapitulate
the large amount of matter before published concerning the Winter
Counts of the Dakota, it has been decided to present in an abbreviated
form the characters and interpretations of the Lone-Dog chart
as being the system which was first discovered, and the publication of
which occasioned the discovery of all the other charts mentioned. The
Winter Count of Battiste Good has not hitherto been published, and it
possesses special importance and interest apart from its chronology, for
which reason it is inserted in the present paper, see infra.</p>

<p>The several charts of The-Flame, The-Swan, American-Horse, and
Cloud-Shield, published in the Fourth Annual Report of the Bureau of
Ethnology, are omitted, but selections from all of them are presented
under the headings of Ideography, Tribal and Personal Designations,
Religion, Customs, History, Biography, Conventionalizing, Comparison,
and in short are interspersed through the present paper where
they appropriately belong.</p>

<p>The reader of the Lone-Dog and Battiste Good charts may find it
convenient to note the following brief account of the tribal names frequently
mentioned:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The great linguistic stock or family which embraces not only the
Sioux or Dakota proper, but the Missouri, Omaha, Ponka, Osage,
Kansa, Oto, Assinaboin, Gros Ventre or Minnitari, Crow, Iowa, Mandan,
and some others, has been frequently styled the Dakota family.
Maj. J. W. Powell, the Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, from
consideration of priority, has lately adopted the name Siouan for the
family, and for the grand division of it popularly called Sioux has used
the term Dakota, which the people claim for themselves.</p>

<p>The word “Dakota” is translated in Riggs’s dictionary of that language
as “leagued” or “allied.” The title Sioux, which is indignantly
repudiated by the people, is either the last syllable or the last two syllables,
according to pronunciation, of “Nadowesioux,” which is the
French plural of the Algonkin name for the Dakotas “Nadowessi,”
“hated foe.” The Ojibwa called the Dakota “Nadowessi,” which is
their word meaning rattlesnake, or, as others translate, adder, with a
contemptuous or diminutive termination; the plural is Nadowessiwak
or Nadawessyak. The French gave the name their own form of the
plural and the voyagers and trappers cut it down to “Sioux.”</p>

<p>The more important of the tribes and organized bands into which the
Dakotas are now divided, being the dislocated remains of the “Seven
Great Council Fires,” are as follows:</p>

<p>Yankton and Yanktonai or Ihankto<sup>n</sup>wạ<sup>n</sup>, both derived from a root
meaning “at the end,” alluding to the former locality of their villages.</p>

<p>Sihasapa, or Blackfeet.</p>

<p>Oheno<sup>n</sup>pa, or Two-Kettles.</p>

<p>Itaziptco, Without Bow. The French equivalent Sans Arc is more
commonly used.</p>

<p>Minneconjou, translated “Those who plant by the water,” the physical
features of their old home.</p>

<p>Sitca<sup>n</sup>gu, Burnt Hip or Brulé.</p>

<p>Santee, subdivided into Wahpeton, Men among Leaves, i. e., among
forests, and Sisseton, Men of Prairie Marsh. Two other bands, now
practically extinct, formerly belonged to the Santee, or as it is more
correctly spelled, Isanti tribes, from the root “Issan,” knife. Their
former territory furnished the material for stone knives, from the manufacture
of which they were called the “knife people.”</p>

<p>Uncpapa, once the most warlike and probably the most powerful of
all the bands, though not the largest.</p>

<p>Oglala. The meaning and derivation of this name and of Uncpapa
have been the subjects of controversy.</p>

<p>Hale, Gallatin, and Riggs designate a “Titon tribe” as located west
of the Missouri, and as much the largest division of the Dakotas, the
latter authority subdividing into the Sicha<sup>n</sup>gu, Itazipcho, Sihasapa,
Minneconjou, Ohenonpa, Oglala, and Huncpapa, seven of the tribes
specified above, which he calls bands. “Titon,” (from the word <i>ti<sup>n</sup>tan</i>,
meaning “at or on land without trees or prairie,”) was the name of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273">[273]</a></span>
tribal division, but it has become only an expression for all those tribes
whose ranges are on the prairie, and thus it is a territorial and accidental,
not a tribular distinction. One of the Dakotas at Fort Rice
spoke to the present writer of the “hostiles” as “Titons,” with obviously
the same idea of locality, “away on the prairie,” it being well known
that they were a conglomeration from several tribes.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 187, 1804-’05.&mdash;The Dakota had a calumet dance and then went
to war. The device is a long pipestem, ornamented with feathers and
streamers. The feathers are white, with black tips, evidently the tail
feathers of the adult golden eagle (Aquila chrysaëtos), highly prized by
the Plains Indians. The streamers anciently were colored
strips of skin or flexible bark; now gayly colored strips
of cloth are used. The word calumet is a corruption of
the French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chalumeau</span>. Capt. Carver (<i>c</i>) in his Three Years
Travels Through the Interior Parts of North America,
after puzzling over the etymology of “calumet,” describes
the pipe as “about 4 feet long, bowl of red marble, stem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274">[274]</a></span>
a light wood curiously painted with hieroglyphics in various colors and
adorned with feathers. Every nation has a different method of decorating
these pipes and can tell at once to what band it belongs. It is used
as an introduction to all treaties, also as a flag of truce is among Europeans.”
Among the Indian tribes generally the pipe, when presented
or offered to a stranger or enemy, was the symbol of peace, yet when
used ceremonially by members of the same tribe among themselves
was virtually a token of impending war. For further remarks on this
point see the year 1842-’43 of this Winter Count.</p></div>

<p>The drawing represents an Indian in the act of catching
an eagle by the legs, as the Arikara were accustomed
to catch eagles in their earth traps. These were
holes to which the eagles were attracted by baits and in
which the Indians were concealed. They rarely or never shot war
eagles. The Arikara was shot in his trap just as he put his hand up
to grasp the bird.</p></div>

figures, taking in connection, afford a good illustration of the method
pursued in the chart, which was not intended to be a continuous
history, or even to record the most important event of
each year, but to exhibit some one of special peculiarity.
There was some incident about the one Ree who was shot
when, in fancied security, he was bringing down an eagle, and
whose death was avenged by his brethren the second year
afterward. It would, indeed, have been impossible to have
graphically distinguished the many battles, treaties, horse-stealings,
big hunts, etc., so most of them were omitted and other events of greater
individuality and better adapted for portrayal were taken for the year
count, the criterion being not that they were of historic moment, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275">[275]</a></span>
that they were of general notoriety, or perhaps of special interest to
the recorders.</p></div>

</div>

<p>Fig. 193, 1810-’11.&mdash;Black-Stone made medicine. The expression
medicine is too common to be successfully eliminated, though it is
altogether misleading. The “medicine men” have no connection with
therapeutics, feel no pulses, and administer no drugs, or, if sometimes
they direct the internal or external use of some secret preparation,
it is as a part of superstitious ceremonies, and with main
reliance upon those ceremonies. Their incantations are not
only to drive away disease, but for many other purposes, such
as to obtain success in war, avert calamity, and were very frequently
used to bring within reach the buffalo, on which the
Dakotas depended for food. The rites are those known as
shamanism, noticeable in the ethnic periods of savagery and
barbarism. In the ceremonial of “making medicine,” a buffalo head,
and especially the head of an albino buffalo, held a prominent place
among the plains tribes. Many references to this are to be found
in the Prince of Wied’s Travels in the Interior of North America. Also
see infra, Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page461">XIV</a></span>. The device in the chart is the man figure, with
the head of an albino buffalo held over his own.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 194.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 194, 1811-’12.&mdash;The Dakota fought a battle with the Gros
Ventres and killed a great many. Device, a circle inclosing
three round objects with flat bases, resembling heads severed
from trunks, which are too minute in this device for decision of
objects represented; but they appear more distinct in the record for
1864-’65 as the heads of enemies slain in battle. In the sign language
of the plains, the Dakota are denoted by drawing a hand across the
throat, signifying that they cut the throats of their enemies. The
Dakota count by the fingers, as is common to most peoples, but with
a peculiarity of their own. When they have gone over the fingers and
thumbs of both hands, one finger is temporarily turned down for <i>one ten</i>.
At the end of the next ten another finger is turned, and so on to a hundred.
<i>Opawinge</i> (<i>Opawi<sup>n</sup>xe</i>), one hundred, is derived from pawinga
(pawi<sup>n</sup>xa), to go round in circles, to make gyrations, and contains the
idea that the round of all the fingers has again been made for their
respective tens. So the circle is never used for less than one hundred,
but sometimes signifies an indefinite number greater than a hundred.
The circle, in this instance, therefore, was at first believed to express
the killing in battle of many enemies. But the other interpretations
removed all symbolic character, leaving the circle simply as the rude<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276">[276]</a></span>
drawing of a dirt lodge to which the Gros Ventres were driven. The
present writer, by no means devoted to symbolism, had supposed a
legitimate symbol to be indicated, which supposition further information
on the subject showed to be incorrect.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 195, 1812-’13.&mdash;Wild horses were first run and caught by the
Dakotas. The device is a lasso. The date is of value, as showing
when the herds of prairie horses, descended from those animals
introduced by the Spaniards in Mexico, or those deposited by
them on the shores of Texas and at other points, had multiplied
so as to extend into the far northern regions. The Dakotas
undoubtedly learned the use of the horse and perhaps also that
of the lasso from southern tribes, with whom they were in contact;
and it is noteworthy that notwithstanding the tenacity with
which they generally adhere to ancient customs, in only two generations
since they became familiar with the horse they had been
so revolutionized in their habits as to be utterly helpless, both in war
and the chase, when deprived of that animal.</p></div>

seemed to explain the fairly drawn feather of that bird protruding
from the lodge top, but the figure must now be admitted
to be a badly drawn bow, in allusion to the tribe Sans
Arc, without, however, any sign of negation. As the interpreter
explained the figure to be a crow feather and as Crow-Feather<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277">[277]</a></span>

in the copy is the same as that for 1801-’02, relating to the smallpox,
except a very slight difference in the red blotches; and, though
Lone-Dog’s artistic skill might not have been sufficient to distinctly
vary the appearance of the two patients, both diseases being
eruptive, still it is one of the few serious defects in the chart
that the sign for the two years is so nearly identical that, separated
from the continuous record, there would be confusion between
them. Treating the document as a mere aide-de-mémoire
no inconvenience would arise, it probably being well known
that the smallpox epidemic preceded that of the measles; but care is
generally taken to make some, however minute, distinction between
the characters. It is also to be noticed that the Indian diagnosis makes
little distinction between smallpox and measles, so that no important
pictographic variation could be expected. The head of this figure is
clearly distinguished from that in 1801-’02.</p></div>

the historic account of which is given in some
detail in Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page551">XVI</a></span>, infra.</p>

<p>Fig. 211, 1826-’27.&mdash;“An Indian died of the dropsy.” So Basil
Clement said. It was at first suggested that this circumstance was
noted because the disease was so unusual in 1826 as to excite remark.
Baron de La Hontan (<i>c</i>), a good authority concerning the Northwestern
Indians before they had been greatly affected by intercourse
with whites, specially mentions dropsy as one of the diseases
unknown to them. Carver, op. cit., also states that this
malady was extremely rare. The interpretations of other charts explained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279">[279]</a></span>
however, that some Dakotas on the warpath had nearly
perished with hunger when they found and ate the rotting carcass of
an old buffalo on which the wolves had been feeding. They were seized
soon after with pains in the stomach, their abdomens swelled, and gas
poured from the mouth. This disease is termed tympanites, the external
appearance occasioned by it much resembling that of dropsy.</p></div>

drew it out and shot him again with the same arrow. The
hand is drawing the arrow from the first wound. This
is another instance of the principle on which events were
selected. Many fights occurred of greater moment, but
with no incident precisely like this. Lame-Deer was a distinguished
chief among the hostiles in 1876. His camp of
five hundred and ten lodges was surprised and destroyed by Gen. Miles,
and four hundred and fifty horses, mules, and ponies were captured.</p></div>

<p>Interpreter Fielder throws light on the subject by saying that
this character was used to designate the year when The-Breast,
father of The-Band, a Minneconjou, died. The-Band
himself died in 1875, on Powder river. His name was O-ye-a-pee. The
character was, therefore, the Buffalo-Breast, a personal name.</p></div>

<p>The word translated “iron” in this case and appearing thus

<p>A successful theft of horses, demanding skill,

the Plains Indians to be of equal merit with the

“a buffalo cow was killed in that year and an old
woman found in her belly;” also that all the Indians
believed this. Good-Wood, examined through another
interpreter, could or would give no explanation except that it was
“about their religion.” The Dakotas have long believed in the appearance
from time to time of a monstrous animal that swallows human
beings. This superstition was perhaps suggested by the bones of mastodons,
often found in the territory of those Indians; and, the buffalo
being the largest living animal known to them, its name was given to
the legendary monster, in which nomenclature they were not wholly
wrong, as the horns of the fossil <i>Bison latifrons</i> are 10 feet in length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283">[283]</a></span>

albino buffalo head. “The elk made you understand
the voice while he was walking.” The interpreter persisted
in this oracular rendering. This device and its interpretation
were unintelligible to the writer until examination of Gen. Harney’s
report, above referred to, showed the name of a prominent chief of the
Minneconjous set forth as “The Elk that Holloes Walking.” It then
became probable that the device simply meant that the aforesaid chief
made buffalo medicine, which conjecture, published in 1877, was verified
by the other records subsequently discovered.</p>

<p>Interpreter A. Lavary said, in 1867, that The-Elk-that-Holloes-Walking,
then chief of the Minneconjous, was then at Spotted-Tail’s camp.
His father was Red-Fish. He was the elder brother of Lone-Horn.
His name is given as A-hag-a-hoo-man-ie, translated The Elk’s Voice
Walking; compounded of he-ha-ka, elk, and omani, walk; this according
to Lavary’s literation. The correct literation of the Dakota
word meaning elk is heqaka; voice, ho; and to walk, walking, mani.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285">[285]</a></span>

eclipse of August 7, 1869, which was central and
total on a line drawn through the Dakota country.
This device has been criticised because Indians generally
believe an eclipse to be occasioned by a dragon or
aerial monster swallowing the sun, and it is contended
that they would so represent it. An answer is that
the design is objectively good, the sun being painted
black, as concealed, while the stars come out red, i. e., bright, and
graphic illustration prevails throughout the charts where it is possible
to employ it.</p>

<p>Dr. Washington Matthews, surgeon, U. S. Army, communicated the
fact that the Dakotas had opportunities all over their country of receiving
information about the real character of the eclipse. He was at Fort
Rice during the eclipse and remembers that long before it occurred the
officers, men, and citizens around the post told the Indians of the coming
event and discussed it with them so much that they were on the
tip-toe of expectancy when the day came. Two-Bears and his band
were then encamped at Fort Rice, and he and several of his leading
men watched the eclipse along with the whites and through their
smoked glass, and then and there the phenomenon was thoroughly
explained to them over and over again. There is no doubt that similar
explanations were made at all the numerous posts and agencies along
the river that day. The path of the eclipse coincided nearly with the
course of the Missouri for over a thousand miles. The duration of
totality at Fort Rice was nearly two minutes (1′ 48″).</p></div>

<p>Fig. 255, 1870-’71.&mdash;The
Uncpapas had a battle
with the Crows, the former
losing, it is said, 14, and
killing 29 out of 30 of the
latter, though nothing appears
to show those numbers.
The central object is
not a circle denoting multitude,
but an irregularly
rounded object, perhaps
intended for one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287">[287]</a></span>
wooden inclosures or forts frequently erected by the Indians, and
especially the Crows. The Crow fort is shown as nearly surrounded,
and bullets, not arrows or lances, are flying. This is the first instance
in this chart in which any combat or killing is portrayed where guns
explicitly appear to be used by Indians, though nothing in the chart
is at variance with the fact that the Dakotas had for a number of years
been familiar with firearms. The most recent indications of any
weapon were those of the arrows piercing the Crow squaw in 1857-’58,
and Brave-Bear in 1854-’55, while the last one before those was the
lance used in 1848-’49, and those arms might well have been employed
in all the cases selected, although rifles and muskets were common.
There is an obvious practical difficulty in picturing, by a single character,
killing with a bullet, not arising as to arrows, lances, dirks, and
hatchets, all of which can be and are shown in the chart projecting
from the wounds made by them. Other pictographs show battles in
which bullets are denoted by continuous dotted lines, the spots at
which they take effect being sometimes indicated, and the fact that
they did hit the object aimed at is expressed by a specially invented
symbol. It is, however, to be noted that the bloody wound on the Ree’s
shoulder (1806-’07) is without any protruding weapon, as if made by a
bullet.</p>

<p>More distinct information regarding this fight, the record of which
concludes the original Lone-Dog chart, has been kindly communicated
by Mr. Luther S. Kelly, of Garfield County, Colorado.</p>

<p>The war party of Uncpapas mentioned charged upon a small trading
post for the Crows on the Upper Missouri river, at the mouth of Musselshell
river. Usually this post was garrisoned by a few frontiersmen,
but on that particular day there happened to be a considerable force
of freighters and hunters. The Indians were afoot and, being concealed
by the sage brush, got within shooting distance of the fort before being
discovered. They were easily driven off, and going a short distance
took shelter from the rain in a circular washout, not having any idea
of being followed by the whites. Meanwhile the whites organized and
followed. The surprise was complete, the leading white man only being
killed. The Indians sang their song and made several breaks to escape,
but were shot down as fast as they rose above the bank. Twenty-nine
were killed.</p>


<h4>BATTISTE GOOD’S WINTER COUNT.</h4>

<p>Dr. William H. Corbusier, surgeon, U. S. Army, while stationed in
1879 and 1880 at Camp Sheridan, Nebraska, near the Pine Ridge Indian
Agency, Dakota, obtained a copy of this Winter Count from its recorder
Baptiste, commonly called Battiste Good, a Brulé Dakota, whose Dakotan
name is given as Wa-po-cta<sup>n</sup>-xi, translated Brown-Hat. He was then living
at the Rose Bud Agency, Dakota, and explained the meaning of the
pictographs to the Rev. Wm. J. Cleveland, of the last named agency,
who translated them into English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The copy made by Battiste Good from his original record, of which
it is said to be a facsimile, is painted in five colors besides black, in
which the outlines are generally drawn, but with the exception of red
blood-marks these colors do not often appear to be significant. This
copy, which was kindly contributed by Dr. Corbusier, is made in an
ordinary paper drawing-book, the last page of which contains the
first record. This is represented in Fig. 256, and pictures what is
supposed to be an introduction in the nature of a revelation. The
next page, reading backwards and corresponding with Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page290">XXI</a></span>, is
a pretended record of a cycle comprising the years (presumed to be in
the Christian chronology) from 901 to 930. Eleven similar pages and
cycles bring the record down to 1700. These pages are only interesting
from the mythology and tradition referred to and suggested by them,
and which must be garnered from the chaff of uncomprehended missionary
teaching. From 1700 to 1880, when the record closes, each
year, or rather winter, is represented by a special character according
to the Dakota system above explained.</p>

<p>Battiste Good, by his own statement in the present record, was born
in the year 1821-’22. Any careful examination of the figures as worked
over by his own hand shows that he has received about enough education
in English and in writing to induce him to make unnecessary
additions and presumptuous emendations on the pictographs as he
found them and as perhaps he originally kept and drew the more recent
of them. He has written English words and Arabic numerals over and
connected with the Dakota devices, and has left some figures in a state
of mixture including the methods of modern civilization and the
aboriginal system. To prevent the confusion to the reader which might
result from Battiste’s meddlesome vanity, these interpolated marks are
in general omitted from the plates and figures as now presented, but,
as specimens of the kind and amount of interference referred to, the
designs on the copy for the years 1700-’01, 1701-’02, and 1707-’08 are
given below as furnished.</p>

<p>The facts stated to have occurred so long ago as the beginning of
the last century can not often be verified, but those of later date given
by Battiste are corroborated by other records in the strongest manner&mdash;that
is, by independent devices which are not mere copies. Therefore,
notwithstanding Battiste’s mythic cycles and English writing, the body
of his record, which constitutes the true Winter Counts, must be regarded
as genuine. He is simply the bad editor of a good work. But whether
or not the events occurred as represented, the pictography is of unique
interest. It may be remarked that Battiste’s record is better known
among the Oglala and Brulé, and Lone-Dog’s Winter Count among
the Minneconjou.</p>

<p>It should be noted that when allusions are made to coloration in
Fig. 256, and in any one of the other figures in the text which illustrate
this Winter Count, they must be understood as applicable to the original.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289">[289]</a></span>
Pls. XXI, XXII, and XXIII are colored copies of those furnished
by Battiste Good, reduced, however, in size.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 256.</span>&mdash;Battiste Good’s Revelation.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 256 illustrates Battiste Good’s introduction. He is supposed to
be narrating his own experience as follows: “In the year 1856, I went
to the Black Hills and cried, and cried, and cried, and suddenly I saw
a bird above me, which said: ‘Stop crying, I am a woman, but I will
tell you something: My Great-Father, Father God, who made this
place, gave it to me for a home and told me to watch over it. He put
a blue sky over my head and gave me a blue flag to have with this
beautiful green country. [Battiste has made the hill country, as well
as the curve for sky and the flag, blue in his copy.] My Great-Father,
Father God (or The Great-Father, God my Father) grew, and his flesh
was part earth and part stone and part metal and part wood and part
water; he took from them all and placed them here for me, and told
me to watch over them. I am the Eagle-Woman who tell you this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290">[290]</a></span>
The whites know that there are four black flags of God; that is, four
divisions of the earth. He first made the earth soft by wetting it, then
cut it into four parts, one of which, containing the Black Hills, he gave
to the Dakotas, and, because I am a woman, I shall not consent to the
pouring of blood on this chief house (or dwelling place), i. e., the Black
Hills. The time will come that you will remember my words; for after
many years you shall grow up one with the white people.’ She then
circled round and round and gradually passed out of my sight. I also
saw prints of a man’s hands and horse’s hoofs on the rocks [here he
brings in petroglyphs], and two thousand years, and one hundred millions
of dollars ($100,000,000). I came away crying, as I had gone. I
have told this to many Dakotas, and all agree that it meant that we
were to seek and keep peace with the whites.”</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Note by Dr. Corbusier.</span>&mdash;The Oglálas and Brulés say that they,
with the rest of the Dakota nation, formerly lived far on the other side
of the Missouri River. After they had moved to the river, they lived
at first on its eastern banks, only crossing it to hunt. Some of the
hunting parties that crossed at length wandered far off from the rest
and, remaining away, became the westernmost bands.)</p>

<p>BATTISTE GOOD’S CYCLES.</p>

<p>A 901-930. B 931-1000.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXI</span> A. The record shown by this figure dates from the appearance
of The-Woman-from-Heaven, 901 A. D.; but the Dakotas were a
people long before this. The circle of lodges represents a cycle of
thirty years, from the year 901 to 930, and incloses the “legend” by
which this period is known. All the tribes of the Dakota nation were
encamped together, as was then their custom, when all at once a beautiful
woman appeared to two young men. One of them said to the
other, “Let us catch her and have her for our wife.” The other said,
“No; she may be something waka<sup>n</sup>” (supernatural or sacred). Then
the woman said to them, “I came from Heaven to teach the Dakotas
how to live and what their future shall be.” She had what appeared
to be snakes about her legs and waist, but which were really braids of
grass. She said, “I give you this pipe; keep it always;” and with the
pipe she gave them a small package, in which they found four grains
of maize, one white, one black, one yellow, and one variegated. The
pipe is above the buffalo. She said, “I am a buffalo, The White-Buffalo-Cow.
I will spill my milk all over the earth, that the people may
live.” She meant by her milk maize, which is seen in the picture dropping
from her udders. The colored patches on the four sides of the
circle are the four quarters of the heavens (the cardinal points of the
compass). In front of the cow are yellow and red. She pointed in this
direction and said, “When you see a yellowish (or brownish) cloud
toward the north, that is my breath; rejoice at the sight of it, for you
shall soon see buffalo. Red is the blood of the buffalo, and by that you
shall live.” Pointing east [it will be noticed that Battiste has placed
the east toward the top of the page], she said, “This pipe is related to
the heavens, and you shall live with it.” The line running from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291">[291]</a></span>
pipe to the blue patch denotes the relation. The Dakotas have always
supposed she meant by this that the blue smoke of the pipe was one with
or nearly related to the blue sky; hence, on a clear day, before smoking,
they often point the stem of the pipe upward, in remembrance of her
words. Pointing south, she said, “Clouds of many colors may come
up from the south, but look at the pipe and the blue sky and know that
the clouds will soon pass away and all will become blue and clear
again.” Pointing west, i. e., to the lowest part of the circle, she said,
“When it shall be blue in the west, know that it is closely related to
you through the pipe and the blue heavens, and by that you shall grow
rich.” Then she stood up before them and said, “I am The White-Buffalo-Cow;
my milk is of four kinds; I spill it on the earth that you may
live by it. You shall call me Grandmother. If you young men will
follow me over the hills you shall see my relatives.” She said this four
times, each time stepping back from them a few feet, and after the
fourth time, while they stood gazing at her, she mysteriously disappeared.
[It is well known that four is the favorite or magic number
among Indian tribes generally, and has reference to the four cardinal
points.] The young men went over the hills in the direction she took
and there found a large herd of buffalo.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Note by Dr. Corbusier.</span>&mdash;Mr. Cleveland states that he has heard
several different versions of this tradition.)</p>

<p>The man who first told the people of the appearance of the woman
is represented both inside and outside the circle. He was thirty years
old at the time, and said that she came as narrated above, in July of
the year of his birth. Outside of the circle, he is standing with a pipe
in his hand; inside, he is squatting, and has his hands in the position
for the gesture-sign for pipe. The elm tree and yucca, or Spanish bayonet,
both shown above the tipis, indicate that in those days the Dakota
obtained fire by rapidly revolving the end of a dry stalk of the yucca
in a hole made in a rotten root of the elm. The people used the bow
and stone-pointed arrows, which are shown on the right. From time
immemorial they have kept large numbers of sticks, shown by the side
of the pipe, each one about as thick and as long as a lead-pencil (sic),
for the purpose of counting and keeping record of numbers, and they
cut notches in larger sticks for the same purpose.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Note by Dr. Corbusier.</span>&mdash;They commonly resort to their fingers
in counting, and the V of the Roman system of notation is seen in the
outline of the thumb and index, when one hand is held up to express
five, and the X in the crossed thumbs, when both hands are held up
together to express ten.)</p>

<p>The bundle of these sticks drawn in connection with the ceremonial
pipe suggests the idea of an official recorder.</p>

<p>Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXI</span> B, 931-1000. From the time the man represented in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXI</span> A
was seventy years of age, i. e., from the year 931, time is counted by cycles
of seventy years until 1700. This figure illustrates the manner of killing
buffalo before and after the appearance of The-Woman. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292">[292]</a></span>
Dakotas had found the buffalo, they moved to the herd and corralled
it by spreading their camps around it. The Man-Who-Dreamed-of-a-Wolf,
seen at the upper part of the circle, with bow and arrow in hand,
then shot the chief bull of the herd with his medicine or sacred arrow;
at this, the women all cried out with joy, “He has killed the chief bull!”
On hearing them shout the man with bow and arrow on the opposite side,
The-Man-Who-Dreamed-of-the-Thunder-and-received-an-arrow-from-the-Thunder-Bird
(wakinyan, accurately translated “the flying one”)
shot a buffalo cow, and the women again shouted with joy. Then all the
men began to shout, and they killed as many as they wished. The
buffalo heads and the blood-stained tracks show what large numbers
were killed. They cut off the head of the chief bull, and laid the pipe
beside it until their work was done. They prayed to The-Woman to
bless and help them as they were following her teachings. Having no
iron or knives, they used sharp stones, and mussel shells, to skin and
cut up the buffalo. They rubbed blood in the hides to soften and tan
them. They had no horses, and had to pack everything on their own
backs.</p>

<p>The cyclic characters that embrace the period from 1001 to 1140 illustrate
nothing of interest not before presented. Slight distinction appears
in the circles so that they can be identified, but without enough
significance to merit reproduction.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXII</span> A, 1141-1210. Among a herd of buffalo, surrounded at one
time during this period, were some horses. The people all cried out,
“there are big dogs with them,” having never seen horses before, hence
the name for horse, sunka (dog) tanka (big), or sunka (dog) wakan (wonderful
or mysterious). After killing all the buffalo they said “let us
try and catch the big dogs;” so they cut a thong out of a hide with a
sharp stone and with it caught eight, breaking the leg of one of them.
All these years they used sharpened deer horn for awls, bone for needles,
and made their lodges without the help of iron tools. [All other
Dakota traditions yet reported in regard to the first capture of horses,
place this important event at a much later period and long after horses
were brought to America by the Spaniards. See this count for the
year 1802-’03, and also Lone-Dog’s Winter Count for the same year.]</p>

<p>Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXII</span> B, 1211-1280. At one time during this period a war party
of enemies concealed themselves among a herd of buffalo, which the
Dakotas surrounded and killed before they discovered the enemy.
No one knows what people, or how many they were; but the Dakotas
killed them all. The red and black lodges indicate war, and that the
Dakotas were successful.</p>

omitted for the same reason as before offered.</p>

<p>Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXIII</span> B, 1631-1700. This represents the first killing of buffalo
on horseback. It was done in the year 1700, inside the circle of lodges
pitched around the herd, by a man who was tied on a horse with thongs
and who received the name of Hunts-inside-the-lodges. They had but
one horse then, and they kept him a long time. Again the bundle of
count-sticks is in the recorder’s hands.</p>

<p>This is the end of the obviously mythic part of the record, in which
Battiste has made some historic errors. From this time forth each
year is distinguished by a name, the explanation of which is in the
realm of fact.</p>

<p>It must be again noted that when colors are referred to in the description
of the text figures, the language (translated) used by Battiste
is retained for the purpose of showing the coloration of the original and
his interpretation of the colors, which are to be imagined, as they can
not be reproduced by the process used.</p>

the hunting ground, after the hunt one day, and were
killed by enemies, of what tribe is unknown. The blood-stained
arrow in the man’s side signifies killed; the
numeral 2 over his head, the number killed; and, the
buffalo heads, the carcass of a buffalo&mdash;which had been
left behind because it was too poor to eat&mdash;together with
the arrow pointing toward them, the hunting-ground.

lake toward the east, near which the Dakotas were encamped, was
frozen over, when they discovered about one thousand buffalo. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294">[294]</a></span>
secured them all by driving them on the ice, through
which they broke, and in which they froze fast. Whenever
the people wanted meat, they cut a buffalo out of
the ice. In the figure, the wave lines represent the water
of the lake; the straight lines, the shore; the blue lines
outside the black ones, trees; the blue patches inside,
the ice through which the heads of the buffalo are seen; the line across

winter’s use. It lasted them all winter, and they found
it all in good condition. The ring surrounding the buffalo
head, in front of the lodge, represents a pit. The
forked stick, which is the symbol for meat, marks the
pit. [Other authorities suggest that the object called
by Battiste a pit, which is more generally called “cache,”
is a heap, and means many or much.]</p>

The Dakotas discovered a party of Pawnees coming

In this chart the Pawnee of the Upper Missouri (Arikara
or Ree), the Pawnee of Nebraska, and the Omaha
are all depicted with legs which look like ears of corn,
but an ear of corn is symbol for the Rees only. The
Pawnee of Nebraska may be distinguished by a lock of
hair at the back of the head; the Omaha, by a cropped
head or absence of the scalp-lock. The absence of all
signs denotes Dakota. Dr. W. Matthews, in Ethnography
and Philology of the Hidatsa Indians, states that the
Arikara separated from the Pawnee of the Platte valley more than a
century ago. [To avoid confusion the literation of the tribal divisions

<p>Fig. 263, 1706-’07.&mdash;“Killed-the-Gros-Ventre-with-snowshoes-on
winter.” A Gros-Ventre (Hidatsa), while
hunting buffalo on snowshoes, was chased by the Dakotas.
He accidentally dropped a snowshoe, and, being
then unable to get through the snow fast enough, they
gained on him, wounded him in the leg, and then killed
him. The Gros-Ventres and the Crows are tribes of the
same nation, and are therefore both represented with
striped or spotted hair, which denotes the red clay they
apply to it.</p>

<p>Fig. 264, 1707-’08.&mdash;“Many-kettle winter.” A man&mdash;1 man&mdash;named
Corn, killed (3) his wife, 1 woman,
and ran off. He remained away for a year,
and then came back, bringing three guns
with him, and told the people that the English,
who had given him these guns, which were the
first known to the Dakotas, wanted him to
bring his friends to see them. Fifteen of the
people accordingly went with him, and when
they returned brought home a lot of kettles or
pots. These were the first they ever saw. Some
numerical marks for reference and the written
words in the above are retained as perhaps
the worst specimens of Battiste’s mixture of civilized methods with the
aboriginal system of pictography. See remarks above, page <a href="#page288">288</a>.</p>

rains fell, which caused the creek to rise suddenly; the bottoms
were flooded, and the occupants of four lodges were

the figure intimate that he was the first Dakota to carry
an umbrella. The advantages of the umbrella were soon
recognized by them, and the first they obtained from the
whites were highly prized. It is now considered an indispensable
article in a Sioux outfit. They formerly wore
a wreath of green leaves or carried green boughs, to
shade them from the sun. The marks used for Cheyenne
stand for the scars on their arms or stripes on their sleeves, which
also gave rise to the gesture-sign for this tribe, see Fig. <a href="#page383">495</a>, infra.</p>

backs, hung from a band passed across the forehead. This
man had a band of iron which is shown on his head. So
said the interpreter, but probably the band was not of the
metal iron. The word so translated has a double meaning
and is connected with religious ideas of water, spirit,
and the color blue.</p>

man was heyoka&mdash;that is, his mind was disordered and
he went about the village bedecked with feathers singing
to himself, and, while so, joined a war party. On sighting
the enemy the party fled, and called to him to turn back
also; as he was heyoka, he construed everything that was
said to him as meaning the very opposite, and therefore,
instead of turning back, he went forward and was killed.
If they had only had sense enough to tell him to go on,
he would then have run away, but the thoughtless people
talked to him just as if he had been in an ordinary condition and of
course were responsible for his death. The mental condition of this
man and another device for the event are explained by other records
(see Fig. <a href="#page466">651</a>).</p>

the body of a man whose hair was done up with
deer-hide in large rolls, and, on cutting them open,
found it was all real hair, very thick, and as long as
a lodge-pole. [Mem. Catlin tells of a Crow called
Long-Hair whose hair, by actual measurement, was
10 feet and 7 inches long.] The fight was at Rawhide
butte (now so called by the whites), which the
Dakotas named Buffalo-Hide butte, because they
found so many buffalo hides in the lodges. According
to Cloud-Shield, Long-Hair was killed in 1786-’87, and according
to American-Horse, Long-Hair, a Cheyenne, was killed in 1796-’97.</p>

meaning that she belonged to God, whereupon
they let her go unharmed. This is the origin
of their name for God (Wakan Tanka, the Great
Holy, or Supernatural One). They had never heard
of a Supernatural Being before, but had offered their
prayers to the sun, the earth, and many other objects,
believing they were endowed with spirits. [Those
are the remarks of Battiste Good, who is only half
correct, being doubtless influenced by missionary teaching. The term
is much older and signifies mystic or unknown.]</p>

never seen any before. In the fall some more came,
and with them, The-Good-White-Man, who is represented
in the figure, and who was the first one to
trade with them. They became very fond of him
because of his fair dealings with them. The gesture
made by his hands is similar to benediction, and
suggests a part of the Indian gesture sign for “good.”</p>

Peeler was a white trader, and his leg was frozen
while he was on his way to or from the Missouri
river. The name is explained by White Cow Killer’s
record as follows: “White-man-peels-the-stick-in-his-hand-broke-his-leg
winter.” He was probably
a Yankee, addicted to whittling.</p>

of a misunderstanding in regard to an old
foot-sore cow, which had been abandoned on the road by
some emigrants and which the Dakotas had innocently
appropriated, Lieut. Grattan, Sixth U. S. Infantry,
killed Conquering Bear (Mato-way'uhi, Startling Bear
properly) about ten miles east of Fort Laramie, August 19, 1854. The
Dakotas then, in retaliation, massacred Lieut. Grattan and the thirty
men of Company G, Sixth U. S. Infantry, he had with him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="subhead">NOTICES.</span></h2>


<p>This is an important division of the purposes for which pictographs
are used. The pictographs and the objective devices antecedent to
them under this head may be grouped as follows: 1st. Notice of visit,
departure, and direction. 2d. Direction by drawing topographic
features. 3d. Notice of condition. 4th. Warning and guidance.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">NOTICE OF VISIT, DEPARTURE, AND DIRECTION.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. G. K. Gilbert, of the U. S. Geological Survey, discovered drawings
at Oakley spring, Yavapai County, Arizona, in 1878. He remarks
that an Oraibi chief explained them to him and said that the “Mokis
make excursions to a locality in the canyon of the Colorado Chiquito
to get salt. On their return they stop at Oakley spring and each Indian
makes a picture on the rock. Each Indian draws his crest or totem,
the symbol of his gens (?). He draws it once, and once only, at each
visit.” Mr. Gilbert adds, further, <span class="lock">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are probably some exceptions to this, but the drawings show its general
truth. There are a great many repetitions of the same sign and from two to ten will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330">[330]</a></span>
often appear in a row. In several instances I saw the end drawings of a row quite
fresh while the others were not so. Much of the work seems to have been performed
by pounding with a hard point, but a few pictures are scratched on. Many drawings
are weather-worn beyond recognition, and others are so fresh that the dust left by
the tool has not been washed away by rain. Oakley spring is at the base of the
Vermilion cliff, and the etchings are on fallen blocks of sandstone, a homogeneous,
massive, soft sandstone. Tubi, the Oraibi chief above referred to, says his totem is
the rain cloud, but it will be made no more, as he is the last survivor of the gens.</p></div>

qu’ils cognoissent par de certaines marques que les chefs se donnent d’une nation a

ils en changent; et par ce moyen ils recognoissent si ce sont amis ou ennemis qui
ont passé.</p></div>

<p>A notice of departure, direction, and purpose made in 1810 by Algonquins,
of the St. Lawrence River, is described by John Merrick in the
Collections of the Maine Historical Society (<i>a</i>), of which the following
is an abstract;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was drawn with charcoal on a chip cut from a spruce tree and wedged firmly
into the top of a stake. It represented two male Indians paddling a canoe in an
attitude of great exertion, and in the canoe were bundles of baggage and a squaw
with a papoose; over all was a bird on the wing ascertained to be a loon. The
whole was interpreted by an Indian pilot on the St. Lawrence, to be a Wickheegan
or Awickheegan, and that it was left by a party of Indians for the information of
their friends. The attitude of exertion showed that the party, consisting of two men,
a woman, and a child, were going upstream. They intended to remain during the
whole period allotted by Indians to the kind of hunting which was then in season,
because they had all their furniture and family in the canoe. The loon expressed
the intention to go without stopping anywhere before they arrived at the hunting
ground, as the loon, from the shortness of its legs, walking with great difficulty,
never alighted on its way.</p></div>

<p>The following account is from Doc. Hist. N.Y. (<i>a</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When they go to war and wish to inform those of the party who may pass their
path, they make a representation of the animal of their tribe, with a hatchet in his
dexter paw; sometimes a saber or a club; and if there be a number of tribes together
of the same party, each draws the animal of his tribe, and their number, all on a
tree from which they remove the bark. The animal of the tribe which heads the
expedition is always the foremost.</p></div>

<p>The three following figures show the actual use of the wikhegan by
the Abnaki in the last generation. Wikhegan is a Passamaquoddy
word which corresponds in meaning nearly to our missive, or letter,
being intelligence conveyed to persons at a distance by marks on a
piece of birch bark, which may be either sent to the person or party
with whom it is desired to hold communication, or may be left in a conspicuous
place for such persons to notice on their expected arrival. In
the cases now figured the wikhegan was left as notice of departure
and direction. They were made at different times by the brother, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331">[331]</a></span>
dead, of Big Raven, baptized as Noel Joseph, who lived all alone on
Long Lake, a few miles from Princeton, Maine. He would not have
anything to do with civilization, and subsisted by hunting and fishing
in the old fashion, nor would he learn a word of French or English.
When he would go on any long expedition his custom was to tie to a
stick conspicuously attached to his wigwam a small roll of birch bark,
with the wikhegan on it for the information of his friends.</p>

<p>The following description of a pictograph on the Pacific coast is extracted

etc., Contrib. to N. A. Ethn. I, p. 222, of the Sound tribes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A party of Snakes are going to hunt strayed horses. A figure of a man, with a long
queue or scalp lock, reaching to his heels, denoted Shoshone; that tribe being in
the habit of braiding horse or other hair into their own in that manner. A number
of marks follow, signifying the strength of the party. A footprint, pointing in the
direction they take, shows their course, and a hoof mark turned backward, that
they expect to return with animals. If well armed, and expecting a possible attack,
a little powder mixed with sand tells that they are ready, or a square dotted about
the figures indicates that they have fortified. These pictographs are often an object
of study to decipher the true meaning. The shrewder or more experienced old men
consult over them. It is not everyone that is sufficiently versed in the subject to
decide correctly.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 442.</span>&mdash;Alaskan notice of direction.</div>
</div>

<p>His explanation of this figure is as follows:</p>

<p>When one of a hunting party is about to return home and wishes to
inform his companions that he has started, he ascends the hilltop
nearest to which they became separated, where he ties a bunch of grass
or other light-colored material to the top of a long stick or pole. The
lower end of the stick is placed firmly in the ground, leaning in the
direction taken. When another hill is ascended, another stick with
similar attachment is erected, again leaning in the direction to be taken.
These sticks are placed at proper intervals until the village is sighted.
This device is employed by Southern Alaskan Indians.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 443.</span>&mdash;Alaskan notice of direction.</div>
</div>

<p>He explained Fig. 443 as follows:</p>

<p>Seal hunters thus inform their comrades
that they have returned to the settlement.
The first to return to the regular
landing place sometimes sticks a piece
of wood into the ground, leaning toward
the village, upon which is drawn or
scratched the outline of a baidarka, or
skin canoe, heading toward one or more
outlines of lodges, signifying that the
occupants of the boat have gone toward
their homes.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 444.</span>&mdash;Alaskan notice
of direction.</div>
</div>

<p>This device is used by coast natives of Southern Alaska and Kadiak.
He explained Fig. 444 as follows:</p>

<p>When hunters become separated, the one first returning
to the forks of the trail puts a piece of wood
in the ground, on the top of which he makes an incision,
into which a short piece of wood is secured horizontally,
so as to point in the direction taken.</p>

<p>Maj. Long&mdash;Keating’s Long (<i>a</i>)&mdash;says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When we stopped to dine, White Thunder (the Winnebago chief that accompanied
me), suspecting that the rest of his party were in the neighborhood, requested a piece
of paper, pen, and ink, to communicate to them the intelligence of his having come
up with me. He then seated himself and drew three rude figures, which, at my request,
he explained to me. The first represented my boat with a mast and flag, with
three benches of oars and a helmsman. To show that we were Americans, our heads
were represented by a rude cross, indicating that we wore hats. The representation
of himself was a rude figure of a bear over a kind of cipher, representing a hunting
ground. The second figure was designed to show that his wife was with him; the
device was a boat with a squaw seated in it; over her head lines were drawn in a
zigzag direction, indicating that she was the wife of White Thunder. The third
was a boat with a bear sitting at the helm, showing that an Indian of that name [or
of the bear gens] had been seen on his way up the river and had given intelligence
where the party were. This paper he set up at the mouth of Kickapoo creek, up
which the party had gone on a hunting trip.</p></div>

<p>An ingenious mode of giving intelligence is practiced at this day by
the Abnaki, as reported by H. L. Masta, chief of that tribe, lately living
at Pierreville, Quebec. When they are in the woods, to say “I am
going to the east,” a stick is stuck in the ground pointing in that direction,
Fig. 445, <i>a</i>. “I am not gone far,” another stick is stuck across
the former, close to the ground, same figure, <i>b</i>. “Gone far” is the
reverse, same figure, <i>c</i>. The number of days’ journey of proposed absence
is shown by the same number of sticks across the first; thus,
same figure, <i>d</i>, signifies five days’ journey.</p>

<p>Fig. 446, scratched on birch bark, was given to the present writer at
Fredericton, New Brunswick, in August, 1888, by Gabriel Acquin, an
Amalecite, then 66 years old, who spoke English quite well. The circumstances
under which it was made and used are in the Amalecite’s
words, as follows:</p>

<p>“When I was about 18 years old I lived at a village 11 miles above
Fredericton and went with canoe and gun. I canoed down to Washademoak
lake, about 40 miles below Fredericton; then took river until
it became too narrow for canoe; then ‘carried’ to Buctoos river; followed
down to bay of Chaleur; went up the northwest Mirimachi, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335">[335]</a></span>
‘carried’ into the Nepisigiut. There spent the summer. On that river
met a friend of my time; we camped there.</p>

<p>“One time while I was away my friend had gone down the river by
himself and had not left any wikhe'gan for me. I had planned to go off
and left for him this wikhe'gan, to tell where I would be and how long
gone. The wigwam at the lower left-hand corner showed the one used
by us, with the river near it. The six notches over the door of the
wigwam meant that I would be gone six days. The canoe and man
nearest to the wigwam referred to my friend, who had gone in the opposite
direction to that I intended to travel. Next to it I was represented
in my own canoe, with rain falling, to show the day I started, which
was very rainy. Then the canoe carried by me by a trail through woods
shows the ‘carry’ to Nictaux lake, beside which is a very big mountain.
I stayed at that lake for six days, counting the outgoing and returning.
As I had put the wikhe'gan in the wigwam before I started, my friend
on his return understood all about me, and, counting six from and including<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336">[336]</a></span>
the rainy day, knew just
when I was coming back, and was
waiting for me.”</p>

<p>The chief point of interest in this
notice is the ingenious mode of fixing
the date of departure. The marks
for rain are nearly obliterated, but it
flows from the man’s hair. The topography
is also delineated.</p>

<p>The following is extracted from
James Long’s Expedition (<i>b</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the bank of the Platte river was a
semicircular row of sixteen bison skulls,
with their noses pointing down the river.
Near the center of the circle which this row
would describe, if continued, was another
skull marked with a number of red lines.</p>

<p>Our interpreter informed us that this
arrangement of skulls and other marks here
discovered were designed to communicate
the following information, namely, that the
camp had been occupied by a war party of
the Skeeree or Pawnee Loup Indians, who
had lately come from an excursion against
the Cumancias, Ietans, or some of the
western tribes. The number of red lines
traced on the painted skull indicated the
number of the party to have been thirty-six;
the position in which the skulls were
placed, that they were on their return to
their own country. Two small rods stuck
in the ground, with a few hairs tied in two
parcels to the end of each, signified that
four scalps had been taken.</p></div>

<p>When a hunting party of the
Hidatsa arrived at any temporary
camping ground from which some of
them had left on a short reconnoitering
expedition, the remainder, having
occasion to move, erect a pole
and cause it to lean in the direction
taken. At the foot of this pole a
buffalo shoulder blade or other flat
bone is placed, upon which is depicted
the reason of departure; e. g.
should buffalo or antelope be seen,
the animal is drawn with a piece of
charred wood or red lead.</p>

<p>When a Hidatsa party has gone
on the warpath, and a certain number<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337">[337]</a></span>
is detailed to take another direction, the point of separation is
taken as the rendezvous. After the return of the first party to the
rendezvous, should the second not come up in a reasonable length of
time, they will set sticks in the ground leaning in the direction to be
taken, and notches are cut into the upper ends of the sticks to represent
the number of nights spent there by the waiting party.</p>

<p>A party of Hidatsa who may be away from home for any purpose
whatever often appoint a rendezvous, from which point they return to
their respective lodges. Should one of the party return to the rendezvous
before any others and wish to make a special trip, he will, for the
information of the others, place a stick of about 3 or 4 feet in length in
the ground, upon the upper end of which a notch is cut, or perhaps a
split made for the reception of a thinner piece of twig or branch having
a length of about a foot. This horizontal top piece is inserted at one
end, so that the whole may point in the direction to be taken. Should
he wish to say that the trail would turn at a right angle, to either
side, at about half the distance of the whole journey in prospect, the
horizontal branch is either bent in that direction or a naturally curved
branch is selected having the turn at the middle of its entire length,
thus corresponding to the turn in the trail. Any direction can be indicated
by curves in the top branch.</p>

<p>No prescribed system of characters is used at the present time by the
Ojibwa, in the indication of direction or travel. When anyone leaves
camp or home for any particular hunting or berry ground, a concerted
arrangement is made by which only those interested can, with any certainty,
recognize “blaze” or trail marks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/dp413_pg337.png" width="400" height="156" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 447.</span>&mdash;Ojibwa notice of direction.</div>
</div>

<p>Three characters cut upon the bark of large pine trees observed in
the forest near Red Lake, Minnesota, are shown in Fig. 447. The
Ojibwa using such a mark will continue on a trail leading from his
home, until he leaves the trail, when a conspicuous tree, or in its absence
a piece of wood or bark, is selected upon which a human figure is
cut, with one arm elevated and pointing in the direction to be taken.
These figures measure about 18 inches in height. Those represented
on the two sides of the copy were cut into the bark of a “jack pine”
without coloration, and the one in the middle had been rubbed with
red chalk upon the wood of the trunk after the bark had been removed
and the incision made. The middle figure indicates the direction by
its bearings, although the pointers are differently arranged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>Plain sticks are sometimes used by the Ojibwa to indicate direction.
These vary in length according to the fancy of the person and the
requirements of the case. They are stuck into the ground, and lean in
the direction to which notice is invited.</p>

<p>When a preconcerted arrangement is made, scrolls of birch bark are
used, upon which important geographic features are delineated, so that
the reader can, with little difficulty, learn the course taken by the
traveler. For instance, a hunter upon leaving his home, deposits there
a scroll bearing marks such as appear in Fig. 448:</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 448.</span>&mdash;Ojibwa notice of direction.</div>
</div>

<p><i>a</i> is a stream to be followed to a lake <i>b</i>, where the hunter will erect
his lodge <i>c</i>, during his stay. The do-dém (totem) is added, used between
persons or parties communicating, to show who was the one that
drew it. It is in the nature of a signature.</p>

<p>Fig. 449 shows a still existing use of the wikhegan between a Penobscot
Indian and his nephew. It is copied from the original, incised on
birch bark, by Nicholas Francis, a Penobscot, of Oldtown, Maine, which
was obtained and kindly presented by Miss A. L. Alger of Boston.</p>

<p>Pitalo (Roaring Lion), English name, Noel Lyon, and his old uncle,
aged over 70 years, went trapping for beaver in 1885 and camped at <i>d</i>,
near Moosehead Lake <i>h</i>, having their supply tent at <i>e</i>. They visited
the ponds <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and knew there were beaver there, and set traps
for them, <i>f f</i>. The beaver dams are also shown extending across the
outlets of the streams. Noel came back from pond <i>b</i> one day to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339">[339]</a></span>
camping tent and found this birch-bark wikhegan made by the old
uncle, who still used the pictographic method, as he does not know how
to write, and by this Noel knew his uncle had gone to pond <i>c</i> to see if
there were any beaver there and would be gone one night, the latter
expressed by one line <i>g</i> drawn between the two arrows pointing in opposite
directions, showing the going and returning on the same trail.</p>

<p>The notable part of the above description is that the wikhegan consisted
of the chart of the geographic features before traversed by the
two trappers, with the addition of new features of the country undoubtedly
known to both of the Indians, but not before visited in the present
expedition. This addition exhibited the departure, its intent, direction,
and duration.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 450.</span>&mdash;Passamaquoddy notice of direction.</div>
</div>

<p>Sapiel Selmo, a chief of the Passamaquoddy tribe, who gave to the
writer the wikhegan copied as Fig. 450, in 1887, was then a very aged
man and has since died. He lived at Pleasant point, 7 miles north of
Eastport, Maine. He was the son of a noted chief, Selmo Soctomah
(a corruption of St. Thomas), who, as shown by a certificate exhibited,
commanded 600 Passamaquoddy Indians in the Revolutionary war.
When a young man Sapiel, with his father, had a temporary camp, <i>a</i>,
at Machias Lake. He left his father and went to their permanent
home at Pleasant Point, <i>b</i>, to get meat, and then returned to the first
camp (route shown by double track) and found that his father had
gone, but that he had left in the temporary wigwam the wikhegan on
birch bark, showing that he had killed one moose, the meat of which
Sapiel found in the snow, and that the father was going to hunt moose<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340">[340]</a></span>
on the other lake (East Machias lake) and would camp there three
days, shown by the same number of strokes at <i>c</i>; so he waited for him
until he came back.</p>

<p>Josiah Gregg (<i>a</i>) says of the Plains tribes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When traveling they will also pile heaps of stones upon mounds or conspicuous
points so arranged as to be understood by their passing comrades; and sometimes
they set up the bleached buffalo heads, which are everywhere scattered over those
plains, to indicate the direction of their march, and many other facts which may
be communicated by those simple signs.</p></div>

<p>Putnam (<i>a</i>) gives one example of this character:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A family of five persons were killed&mdash;a tall man, a short, fat woman, and three
children&mdash;at some place to the north. Five sticks were cut of various lengths. The
longest being forked or split indicated the man, the thick short one the woman,
and three of smaller sizes and lengths the children. They were all scalped, as is
shown by the peeling of the bark. There were thirteen Indians, as we are informed
by the stick with stripes and thirteen notches; and they have fled south with two
prisoners, as we judge from the pointer and little strips of bark seemingly tied
together. Sometimes all the intimations would be on one stick or piece of bark. A
spy finding, at places well known, some of these mysterious articles, would bring
them to the station, where a consultation would be held and conclusion drawn as to
the meaning. A spy or hunter would intimate to his friend his want of powder or
lead or other want and the place at which he would look for supplies.</p></div>

<p>Hind (<i>a</i>) speaks of a special form of notice by the natives of the Labrador
peninsula:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To indicate their speed and direction on a march, the Nasquapees of the Labrador
peninsula thrust a stick in the ground, with a tuft of grass at the top, pointing
toward their line of route, and they show the rate at which they are traveling by
the greater or less inclination of the stick. This mode of communicating intelligence
to those who may follow is universal among Indians; but the excellent and simple
contrivance for describing the speed at which they travel is not generally employed
as far as I am aware, by other nations.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Charles G. Leland, in a letter, tells that the English gypsies, at
a crossroad, drew the ordinary Latin cross with the long arm pointing
in the direction taken. Others pulled up three bunches of grass by the
roots and laid the green points in the direction. Others again, at the
present time, take a small stick and set it up inclining at an angle of
45 degrees in the line of travel.</p>

<p>Dr. George M. Dawson (<i>a</i>) reports of the Shuswap people of British
<span class="lock">Columbia&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A rag of clothing, particularly a small piece or pieces of colored or other easily
recognizable material from a woman’s dress, left in a forked twig, indicates that a
person or party of persons has passed. If the stick stands upright, it means that
the hour was noon, if inclined it may either point to the direction of the sun at the
time or show the direction in which the person or party went. If it is desired to
show both, a larger stick points to the position of the sun, a smaller to that of the
route followed. If those for whose information the signs are left are likely to arrive
after an interval of several days, a handful of fresh grass or a leafy branch may be
left, from the condition of which an estimate of the time which has elapsed can be
formed. Such signs are usually placed near the site of the camp fire.</p></div>

<p>The device to indicate the time of depositing the notice may be compared
with that shown in Fig. 446.</p>

with charcoal its bays, capes, and the mouths of rivers with such
accuracy that Massachusetts bay and Merrimack river have been identified.</p>

<p>On lake Tash-ner-nus-kow, Labrador, was found a “letter” stuck in a cleft pole

of the country, with arrows showing the direction the writer had taken, some crosses
indicating where he had camped, and a large cross to show where he intended to
make his first winter quarters. It was probably written by some Nasquapees as a
guide to others who might be passing up the river or hunting in the country.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Hoffman tells how at Grapevine springs, Nevada, in 1871, the
Paiute living at that locality informed the party of the relative position
of Las Vegas, the objective point. The Indian sat upon the sand and
with his hands formed an oblong ridge to represent Spring mountain,
and southeast of this ridge another gradual slope, terminating on the
eastern side more abruptly; over the latter he passed his fingers to
represent the side valleys running eastward. He then took a stick and
showed the direction of the old Spanish trail running east and west
over the lower portion of the last-named ridge. When this was completed,
with a mixture of English, Spanish, Paiute, and gesture signs,
he told that from where they were now they would have to go southward
east of Spring mountain to the camp of Paiute Charlie, where they
would have to sleep; then indicated a line southeastward to another
spring (Stump’s) to complete the second day; then he followed the line
representing the Spanish trail to the east of the divide of the second
ridge above named, where he left it, and passing northward to the first
valley he thrust the short stick into the ground and said, “Las Vegas.”</p>

<p>Mr. W. von Streeruwitz, of the Geological Survey of Texas, contributes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344">[344]</a></span>
the copy of a map, evidently the work of Indians, which is received
too late for reproduction. The map is roughly scratched into the flat
surface of a large granite block, and is an approximately correct sketch
of a pass and the nearest surrounding. The rock is situated in the pass
above the so-called rattlesnake or mica tank, in a spur on the west side
of the Van Horn mountains, El Paso county, Texas. An Indian trail
passes near the very rough and weathered rear part of the rock, which
on this side shows weak traces of some scratched-in drawings, which
are nearly weathered off, made no doubt with the purpose to lead the
attention of passing parties to the other side of the rock upon which
the map is drawn. An old trail leads from the Rio Grande across the
Eagle mountains to this pass and in the shortest line from the Green
river valley to the northern main range of the Van Horn and from
there east to the Davis mountains, formerly Apache mountains, and
thence through the southern extension of the Guadeloupe mountains
to this range and into New Mexico; also through the Sierra Carrizo to
the Sierra Diablo; so that this trail must be regarded as one of the
best warpaths for raids across the Rio Grande. An arrowhead at the
upper end of the trail points out water (small or doubtful supply), as
far as could be ascertained from drawings made by Apaches.</p>

<p><i>h</i> is the Chinese character for “flowing water,” from Edkins, p. 23.
“In the Chwen wen three strokes descending indicate the appearance
of flowing water as seen in a river. The two outside strokes are broken
in the middle.”</p>

<p>The same authority, p. 155, gives another character, <i>i</i>, with the same
meaning as the last. The author says: “It is supposed to be turned
on end. It is better to regard the old form with its three descending
lines as a picture of water flowing downward.”</p>

of land after the deluge.</p>

<p>G. Holm (<i>a</i>) gives the following account, translated and condensed,
descriptive of Fig. 455, a wooden map made by the natives of the east
coast of Greenland:</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In reference to map making I will only remark that many are inclined to enlarge
the scale as they approach the better known places, which in fact is quite natural,
as they would not otherwise find room for all details. As a natural result, map drawing
in the form of ground plat is something quite new to them. Their mode of
representing their land is by carving it on wood. This has the advantage that not
only the contour of the land, but also its appearance and rock forms, can in a certain
degree be represented.</p>

<p>The block of wood brought back represents the tract between Kangerdluarsikajik,
east of Sermiligak, and Sieralik, north of Kangerdlugsuatsiak. The mainland continues
from one side of the wooden block to the other, while the islands are located
on the accompanying block without regard to the distance between them in reference
to the mainland. All places where there are old ruins of houses, and therefore
good storage places, are marked on the wood map, which also shows the points
where a kayak can be carried over the ground between two fiords when the sea ice
blocks the headland outside. This kind of models serves to represent the route the
person in question has followed, inasmuch as during his recital he moves the stick,
so that the islands are shown in their relative positions. The other wooden map,
which was prepared by request, represents the peninsula between Sermiligak and
Kangerdluarsikajik.</p>

<p>A and B represent the tract between Kangerdluarsikajik (immediately east of
Sermiligak) and Sieralik (slightly north of Kangerdlugsuatsiak). B represents the
coast of the mainland, and is continuous from one side of the block to the other,
while the outlying islands are represented by the wooden block of A, on which the
connecting pieces between the various islands must be imagined as being left out.
While the narrator explains the map he moves the stick to and fro, so as to get the
islands into the right position in reference to the mainland.</p>

<p>Kunit explained the map to me. The names of the islands on A are: <i>a</i>, Sardlermiut,
on the west side of which is the site of an old settlement; <i>b</i>, Nepinerkit (from
napavok), having the shape of a pyramid; <i>c</i>, Ananak, having the site of an old settlement
on the southwest point. (<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Others give the name Ananak to the cape
on the mainland directly opposite, calling the island Kajartalik.) <i>d</i>, Aputitek; <i>e</i>,
Itivdlersuak; <i>f</i>, Kujutilik; <i>g</i>, Sikivitik.</p>

<p>For B I obtained the following names, beginning at the north, as in the case of
the islands: <i>h</i>, Itivdlek, where there are remains of a house; <i>i</i>, Sierak, a small fiord,
in which salmon are found; <i>k</i>, Sarkarmiut, where there are remains of a house; <i>l</i>,
Kangerdlugsuatsiak, a fiord of such length that a kayak can not even in a whole
day row from the mouth to the head of the fiord and back again; <i>m</i>, Erserisek, a
little fiord; <i>n</i>, Nutugat, a little fiord with a creek at the bottom; <i>o</i>, Merkeriak,
kayak portage from Nutugkat to Erserisek along the bank of the creek, when the
heavy ice blocks the headland between the two fiords; <i>p</i>, Ikerasakitek, a bay in
which the land ice goes straight out to the sea; <i>q</i>, Kangerajikajik, a cape; <i>r</i>, Kavdlunak,
a bay into which runs a creek; <i>s</i>, Apusinek, a long stretch where the land
ice passes out into the sea; <i>t</i>, Tatorisik; <i>u</i>, Iliartalik, a fiord with a smaller creek;
<i>v</i>, Nuerniakat; <i>x</i>, Kugpat; <i>y</i>, Igdluarsik; <i>z</i>, Sangmilek, a little fiord with a creek;
<i>aa</i>, Nutugkat; <i>bb</i>, Amagat; <i>cc</i>, Kangerdluarsikajik, a smaller fiord; <i>dd</i>, Kernertuarsik.</p>

<p>C represents the peninsula between the fiords Sermiligak and Kangerdluarsikajik.</p></div>

<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">NOTICE OF CONDITION.</span></h3>

<p>In the curious manuscript of Gideon Lincecum, written with Roman
characters in the Choctaw language about 1818, and referring to the
ancient customs of that tribe, appears the following passage (p. 276):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They had a significant and very ingenious method of marking the stakes so that
each iksa could know its place as soon as they saw the stake that had been set
up for them. Every clan had a name, which was known to all the rest. It was a
species of heraldry, each iksa having its coat of arms. The iksas all took the name
of some animal&mdash;buffalo, panther, dog, terrapin, any race of animals&mdash;and a little
picture of whatever it might be, sketched on a blazed tree or stake, indicated the
clan to which it belonged. They could mark a tree when they were about to leave
a camp, in their traveling or hunting excursions, with a set of hieroglyphs, that any
other set of hunters or travelers who might pass that way could read, telling what
iksa they belonged to, how long they had remained at that camp, how many there
were in the company, if any were sick or dead, and if they had been successful or
otherwise in the hunt. Thus, drawn very neatly on a peeled tree near the camp, a
terrapin; five men marching in a row, with bows ready strung in their hands, large
packs on their backs, and one man behind, no pack, bow unstrung; one circle,
half circle, and six short marks in front of the half circle; below, a bear’s head, a
buffalo head, and the head of an antelope. The reading is, “Terrapin iksa, 6 men
in company, one sick; successful hunt in killing bear, buffalo, and antelope; that
they remained at the camp a moon and a half and six days, and that they have gone
home.”</p></div>

<p>Among the Abnaki of the Province of Quebec, as reported by Masta,
their chief, cutting the bark off from a tree on one, two, three, or four
sides near the butt means “Have had poor, poorer, poorest luck.”
Cutting it off all around the tree means “I am starving.” Smoking a
piece of birch bark and hanging it on a tree means “I am sick.”</p>

<p>Tanner’s Narrative (<i>c</i>) mentions regarding the Ojibwa that, in cases
where the information to be communicated is that the party mentioned
is starving, the figure of a man is sometimes drawn, and his mouth is
painted white, or white paint may be smeared about the mouth of the
animal, if it happens to be one, which is his totem.</p>

<p>Fig. 456 is a copy of a drawing incised on birch bark by the old
Passamaquoddy chief, Sapiel Selmo, who made comments upon it as
follows: Two hunters followed the river <i>a</i> until it branches off <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>.
Indian <i>d</i> takes one river and its lakes and small branches, and the
other hunter (not figured in the chart) follows the other branch and
also claims its small streams and lakes. Sometimes during the winter
they visit one another. If it happen that the other hunter was away
from his wigwam <i>e</i> and if the visiting hunter wishes to leave word with
his friend and wishes to inform him of his luck, he makes a picture on a
piece of birch bark and describes such animals he has killed with the
number of animals as seen in <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> (figure of moose’s head) which,
with two crosses to each, means 20 moose. He killed in each hunt
altogether 40. <i>h</i> is a whole moose, also with two crosses, and means
20, and also the figure of a caribou <i>i</i> with one cross means 10 caribou,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348">[348]</a></span>
and also a figure of a bear with four crosses <i>j</i> means 40 bears, and <i>k</i>
shows a figure of bear with one cross which means 10 bears, and also a
sable <i>l</i> with five crosses means 50 sables. If he wish to inform him
he is in poor luck and hungry, he marked a figure of an Indian with a
pot on one hand, the pot upside down; this means hunger. A figure
of an Indian in lying position means sickness.</p>

<p>Fig. 457 was also incised on birch bark by Sapiel Selmo and described
by him.</p>

<p>Two Indian hunters follow the river to hunt. They go together as
far as the river’s forks and then separate. One went to the river <i>c</i>.
The other follows river <i>e</i> and kills a moose. They both build their
winter wigwams.</p>

<p>Indian <i>b</i> went to hunt and found a bear’s den under the foot of a big
tree. He attempted to stab the bear, but missed the vital part. The
bear got hold of him, bit him severely, and mortally wounded him. He
went to his wigwam <i>h</i> and thinks he is going to die, so he makes his
mark or wikhegan on a birch-bark. He makes notches <i>j</i> on the bark
to mean his tracks and also marks a tree as in <i>f</i> and also a bear as in <i>g</i>.
His friend <i>d</i> came to visit him and found him lying dead in his wigwam,
and also found the marks on the piece of birch-bark, which he read and
knew at once his partner was killed by the bear, and he followed his
bear tracks, and he also found the bear dead.</p>

<p>Fig. 458 originally scraped on birch bark tells its own story, but was
described by Sapiel Selmo, who drew it, thus:</p>

<p>Two Indian hunters, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, went to hunt and follow river, <i>a</i>. They
continued together as far as <i>d</i>, where the river branches off. Indian
<i>c</i> follows the east branch <i>e</i>. He went as far as lake <i>f</i>, where he built
his wigwam <i>g</i>. Indian <i>c</i> is very unlucky; he doesn’t kill any bears or
moose, so he became very hungry. Indian <i>b</i>, who had followed the
north branch and built his wigwam, <i>l</i>, near lake <i>k</i>, went to visit Indian
<i>c</i>, who was away at the time, but <i>b</i> found mark on the birch bark, a
pot upside down, <i>h</i>; this means hunger. He also makes his own mark,
<i>i</i>, a moose’s head, showing success. He appoints lake <i>j</i>, where he killed
moose, and wants him, <i>c</i>, to come to his, <i>b</i>’s, wigwam <i>l</i>.</p>

<p><i>o</i>, lower lake, not connected with the story, but doubtless drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350">[350]</a></span>
to complete the topography. The two trails, <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>, are designated
by notches showing foot-path or snow-shoe tracks. The Abnaki have
footpaths or snow-shoe tracks where the line of kelhign sisel, or sable
dead falls, extends from one hunting camp to another, between two
lakes or rivers.</p>

<p>The Ottawa and the Pottawatomi Indians indicate hunger and starvation
by drawing a black line across the breast or stomach of the figure
of a man. (See Fig. <a href="#page656">1046</a>.) This drawing is either incised upon a piece
of wood, or drawn on it with a mixture of powdered charcoal and glue
water, or red ocher. The piece of wood is then attached to a tree or
fastened to a pole, and erected near the lodge on a trail, where it will
be observed by passers by, who are thus besought to come to the rescue
of the sufferer who erected the notice.</p>

<p>Fig. 459 illustrates information with regard to distress in another
village, which occasioned the departure of the party giving the notification.
The drawing was made in 1882 by the Alaskan, Naumoff, in
imitation of drawings used at his home. The designs are traced upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351">[351]</a></span>
a strip of wood, which is then stuck upon the roof of the house belonging
to the draftsman.</p>

<p>The drawing, Fig. 460, also made in 1882, by a native Alaskan, in
imitation of originals familiar to him in Alaska, is intended to be
placed in a conspicuous portion of a settlement which has been attacked
by a hostile force and finally deserted. The last one to leave prepares
the drawing upon a strip of wood to inform friends of the resort of the
survivors.</p>

<p>The design shown in Fig. 461 is in imitation of drawings made by
natives of Southern Alaska to convey to the observer the information
that the draftsman had gone away to another settlement, the inhabitants
of which were in distress. The drawings were made on a strip
of wood which was placed at the door of the house, where it might be
seen by visitors or inquirers.</p>

<p>Naumoff gave the following explanation: <i>a</i>, a native making the
gesture of indicating <i>self</i> with the right hand and with the left indicating
direction of <i>going</i>; <i>b</i>, the native’s habitation; <i>c</i>, scaffold used
for drying fish; upon the top of a pole is placed a piece of wood tied

party; <i>d</i>, the baidarka conveying it; <i>e</i>, a native of the settlement
to be visited; <i>f</i>, summer habitation; <i>g</i>, “shaman stick,” or grave stick,
erected to the memory of a recently deceased person, the cause which
has necessitated the journey; <i>h</i>, winter habitation. This, together with
<i>f</i>, indicates a settlement.</p>

<p>When a hunter is tracking game and exhausts his

part of the trail and sticks his ihú<sup>n</sup>ŭk in the
ground, the top leaning in the direction taken. The
ihú<sup>n</sup>ŭk is the pair of sticks arranged like the letter
A, used as a gun-rest. This method of transmitting

<h3>SECTION 4.<br />

<span class="subhead">WARNING AND GUIDANCE.</span></h3>

<p>The following description of an Ojibwa notice of a murderer’s being
at large is extracted from Tanner’s Narrative: (<i>d</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As I was one morning passing one of our usual encamping places I saw on shore a
little stick standing in the bank and attached to the top of it a piece of birchbark.
On examination I found the mark of a rattlesnake with a knife, the handle touching
the snake and the point sticking into a bear, the head of the latter being down.
Near the rattlesnake was the mark of a beaver, one of its dugs, it being a female,
touching the snake. This was left for my information, and I learned from it that
Wa-me-gon-a-biew, whose totem was She-she-gwah, the rattlesnake, had killed a
man whose totem was Muk-kwah, the bear. The murderer could be no other than
Wa-me-gon-a-biew, as it was specified that he was the son of a woman whose totem
was the beaver, and this I knew could be no other than Net-no-kwa.</p></div>

<p>An amusing instance of the notice or warning, “No thoroughfare,”
is presented in Fig. 466. It was taken in 1880 from a rock drawing in
Canyon de Chelly, New Mexico, by Mr. J. K. Hillers, photographer of
the U. S. Geological Survey.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 466.</span>&mdash;No thoroughfare.</div>
</div>

<p>The design on the left is undoubtedly a notice in the nature of warning,
that, although a goat can climb up the rocky trail, a horse would
tumble down.</p>

<p>During his connection with the geographic surveys west of the one
hundredth meridian, Dr. Hoffman observed a practice among the
Tivátikai Shoshoni, of Nevada, of erecting heaps of stones along or near
trails to indicate the direction to be taken and followed to reach springs<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354">[354]</a></span>
of water. Upon slight elevations of ground, or at points where a trail
branched into two or more directions, or at the intersection of two
trails, a heap of stones would be placed varying in height according to
the elevation requisite to attract attention. Upon the top of this would
be fixed an elongated piece of rock so placed that the most conspicuous
point projected and pointed in the course to be followed. This was
continued sometimes at intervals of several miles unless indistinct
portions of a trail or intersections demanded a repetition at shorter
distances. A knowledge of this custom proved very beneficial to the
early prospectors and pioneers.</p>

<p>Fig. 467 is a copy, one-sixteenth actual size, of colored petroglyphs
found by Dr. Hoffman in 1884 on the North fork of the San Gabriel
river, also known as the Azuza canyon, Los Angeles county, California.</p>

of the rocks bearing the paintings.</p>

<p>The stream is hemmed in by precipitous mountains, with the exception
of two points marked <i>c c</i>, over which the old Indian trail passed
in going from the Mojave desert on the north to the San Gabriel valley
below, this course being the nearest for reaching the mission settlements
at San Gabriel and Los Angeles. In attempting to follow the
water course the distance would be greatly increased and a rougher
trail encountered. Fig. 467, painted on the rock marked <i>b</i> on the map,
shows characters in pale yellow upon a bowlder of almost white granite
partly obliterated by weathering and annual floods, though still enough
remains to indicate that the right-hand figure is directing the observer
to the northeast, although upon taking that course it would be necessary
to round the point a short distance to the west. It may have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356">[356]</a></span>
placed as a notification of direction to those Indians who might have
come up the canyon instead of on the regular trail. Farther west, at
the spot marked <i>a</i> on the map, is a granite bowlder bearing a large
number of paintings, part of which have become almost obliterated.
These were drawn with red ocher (ferric oxide). A selection of these
is shown in Fig. 469.</p>

</div>

<p>This is on the almost vertical western face of the rock. These characters
also appear to refer to the course of the trail, which might
readily be lost on account of the numerous mountain ridges and spurs.
The left-hand human figure appears to place its hand upon a series of
ridges, as if showing pantomimically the rough and ridged country
over the mountains.</p>

<p>The middle figure is making a gesture which in its present connection
may indicate direction of the trail, i. e., toward the left, or northward
in an uphill course, as indicated by the arm and leg, and southward,
or downward, as suggested by the lower inclination of the leg
and lower forearm and hand on the right of the painting.</p>

<p>These illustrations, as well as other pictographs on the same rock,
not now represented, exhibit remarkable resemblance to the general
type of Shoshonean drawing, and from such evidence as is now attainable
it is probable that they are of Chemehuevi origin, as that tribe at
one time ranged far to the west, though north of the mountains, and also
visited the valley and settlements at Los Angeles to trade. It is also
known that the Mojaves came at stated periods to Los Angeles as late
as 1845, and the trail indicated at point <i>a</i> of the map would appear to
have been their most practicable and convenient route. There is strong
evidence that the Moki sometimes visited the Pacific coast and might
readily have taken this same course, marking the important portions
of the route by drawings in the nature of guideboards.</p>

<p>The following curious account is taken from The Redman, Carlisle,
October, 1888:</p>

<p>A ranchman visiting a deserted camp of Piegans found the following
notice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We called at this ranch at dinner time. They treated us badly, giving us no dinner
and sending us away. There is a head man who has two dogs, one of which has
no tail. There are two larger men who are laborers. They have two pairs of large
horses and two large colts, also another smaller pair of horses and two ponies which
have two colts.</p>

<p>The notice was composed thus: A circle of round stones represented the horses
and ponies, the latter being smaller stones; the stones outside of the circle meant
there were so many colts. Near the center was a long narrow stone, upon the end
of which was a small one. This denoted the head man or owner, whose two dogs
were shown by two pieces of bark, one with a square end while the other had a twig
stuck in for a tail. Two other long narrow stones, larger than the first, stood for
the laborers; these had no small stones on them. Some sticks of wood, upon which
was a small pile of buffalo chips, meant that dinner was ready; and empty shells
turned upside down told they got nothing to eat, but were sent away.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Charles W. Cunningham, formerly of Phœnix, Arizona, reports<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357">[357]</a></span>
the finding of petroglyphs in Rowe canyon, one-half mile from the base
of Bradshaw mountain, Arizona. The characters are pecked upon its
vertical wall of hard porphyry, covering a space between 12 or 15 feet
in length and about 30 feet above the surface of the earth. They consist
of human figures with outstretched arms, apparently driving animals
resembling sheep or goats, while at the head of the procession
appears the figure of a bear. The explanation given seems to be a
notification to Indian herders that in going through the canyon they
should be careful to guard against bears or possibly other dangerous
animals, as the trail or canyon leads down to some water tanks where
the herders may habitually have driven the stock.</p>

<p>D’Albertis (<i>b</i>) mentions of the Papuans that a warning not to enter a
dwelling is made by erecting outside of it a stick, on the top of which
is a piece of bark or a cocoanut, and in Yule island these warnings or
taboo sticks are furnished with stone heads.</p>

<p>When a Tartar shaman wished to be undisturbed he placed a dried
goat’s-head, with its prominent horns, over a wooden peg outside of his
tent and then dropped the curtain. No one would dare to venture in.</p>

<p>The following is quoted from Franz Keller (<i>b</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the immense primeval forests, extending between the Ivahy and the Paranapanama,
the Paraná and the Tibagy, the rich hunting grounds of numerous Coroado
hordes, one frequently encounters, chiefly near forsaken palm sheds, a strange collection
of objects hung up between the trees on thin cords or cipós, such as little
pieces of wood, feathers, bones, and the claws and jaws of different animals.</p>

<p>In the opinion of those well versed in Indian lore these hieroglyphs are designed
as epistles to other members of the tribe regarding the produce of the chase, the
number and stay of the huntsmen, domestic intelligence, and the like; but this
strange kind of composition, reminding one of the quippus (knotted cords), of the
old Peruvians, has not yet been quite unraveled, though it is desirable that it should
be, for the naïve son of the woods also uses it sometimes in his intercourse with the
white man.</p>

<p>Settlers in this country, on going in the morning to look after their very primitive
mills near their cottages, have frequently discovered them going bravely, but bruising
pebbles instead of the maize grains, while on the floor of the open shed names
and purposes of the unwelcome nocturnal visitors have been legibly written in the
sand. Among the well-drawn zigzag lines were inserted the magnificent long tail
feathers of the red and blue macaw, which are generally used by the Coroados for
their arrows; and, as these are the symbols of war and night attacks, the whole was
probably meant for a warning and admonition ad hominem: “Take up your bundle
and go or beware of our arrows.”</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="subhead">COMMUNICATIONS.</span></h2>


<p>Under this heading notes and illustrations are grouped of transmitted
drawings, which were employed as letters and missives now are by people
who possess the art of writing. To the drawings are added some
descriptions of objects sent for the same purposes. These are sometimes
obviously ideographic, but often appear to be conventional or arbitrary.
It is probable that the transmittal or exchange of such objects anteceded
the pictorial attempt at correspondence, so that the former should be
considered in connection with the latter. The topic is conveniently
divided by the purposes of the communications, viz, (1) declaration of
war, (2) profession of peace and friendship, (3) challenge, (4) social and
religious missives, (5) claim or demand.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">DECLARATION OF WAR.</span></h3>

<p>Le Page du Pratz (<i>a</i>), in 1718, reported the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Natchez make a declaration of war by leaving a hieroglyphic picture against
a tree in the enemy’s country, and in front of the picture they place, saltierwise, two
red arrows. At the upper part of the picture at the right is the hieroglyphic sign
which designates the nation that declares war; next, a naked man, easy to recognize,
who has a casse-tête in his hand. Following is an arrow, drawn so as in its
flight to pierce a woman, who flees with her hair spread out and flowing in the air.
Immediately in front of this woman is a sign belonging to the nation against which
war is declared; all this is on the same line. That which is below is not so clear or
so much relied upon in the interpretation. This line begins with the sign of a moon
(<i>i. e.</i>, month) which will follow in a short time. The days that come afterward are
indicated by straight strokes and the moon by a face without rays. There is also a
man who has in front of him many arrows which seem directed to hit a woman who
is in flight. All that announces that when the moon will be so many days old they
will come in great numbers to attack the designated nation.</p></div>

<p>Lahontan (<i>a</i>) writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The way of declaring war by the Canadian Algonquian Indians is this: They send
back to the nation that they have a mind to quarrel with a slave of the same country,
with orders to carry to the village of his own nation an axe, the handle of which is
painted red and black.</p></div>

<p>The Huron-Iroquois of Canada sent a belt of black wampum as a
declaration of war.</p>

<p>Material objects were often employed in declaration of war, some of
which may assist in the interpretation of pictographs. A few instances
are mentioned:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>Capt. Laudonnière (<i>a</i>) says: “Arrows, to which long hairs are attached,
were stuck up along the trail or road by the Florida Indians,
in 1565, to signify a declaration of war.”</p>

<p>Dr. Georg. Schweinfurth (<i>a</i>) gives the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I may here allude to the remarkable symbolism by which war was declared against
us on the frontiers of Wando’s territory. * * * Close on the path, and in full
view of every passenger, three objects were suspended from the branch of a tree, viz,
an ear of maize, the feather of a fowl, and an arrow. * * * Our guides readily
comprehended and as readily explained the meaning of the emblems, which were
designed to signify that whoever touched an ear of maize or laid his grasp upon a
single fowl would assuredly be the victim of the arrow.</p></div>

<p>In the Notes on Eastern Equatorial Africa, by MM. V. Jacques (<i>a</i>)
and É. Storms, it is stated that when a chief wishes to declare war he
sends to the chief against whom he has a complaint an ambassador
bearing a leaden bullet and a hoe. If the latter chooses the bullet, war
ensues; if the hoe, it means that he consents to enter into negotiations
to maintain peace.</p>

<p>Terrien de Lacouperie, op. cit., pp. 420, 421, reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The following instance in Tibeto-China is of a mixed character. The use of material
objects is combined with that of notched sticks. When the Li-su are minded
to rebel they send to the Moso chief (who rules them on behalf of the Chinese Government)
what the Chinese call a muhki and the Tibetans a shing-tchram. It is a
stick with knife-cut notches. Some symbols are fastened to it, such, for instance,
as a feather, calcined wood, a little fish, etc. The bearer must explain the meaning
of the notches and symbols. The notches may indicate the number of hundreds or
thousands of soldiers who are coming; the feather shows that they arrive with the
swiftness of a bird; the burnt wood, that they will set fire to everything on their
way; the fish, that they will throw everybody into the water, etc. This custom is
largely used among all the savage tribes of the region. It is also the usual manner
in which chiefs transmit their orders.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">PROFESSION OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP.</span></h3>

<p>The following account of pictorial correspondence leading to peace
was written by Governor Lewis Cass, while on one of his numerous
missions to the Western tribes, before 1820:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some years before, mutually weary of hostilities, the chiefs of the Ojibwas and
the Dakotas met and agreed upon a truce. But the Sioux, disregarding the solemn
contract which they had formed, and actuated by some sudden impulse, attacked the
Ojibwas and murdered a number of them.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Sandy lake I proposed to the Ojibwa chiefs that a deputation
should accompany us to the mouth of the St. Peters, with a view to establish a permanent
peace between them and the Sioux. The Ojibwas readily acceded to this, and
ten of their principal men descended the Mississippi with us. The computed distance
from Sandy lake to the St. Peters is 600 miles. As we neared this part of the country
we found our Ojibway friends cautious and observing.</p>

<p>The Ojibwa landed occasionally to examine whether any of the Sioux had recently
visited that quarter. In one of these excursions an Ojibwa found in a conspicuous
place a piece of birch bark, made flat by fastening between two sticks at each end,
and about 18 inches long by 2 broad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>This bark contained the answer of the Sioux nation. So sanguinary had been the
contest between these two tribes that no personal communication could take place.
Neither the sanctity of office nor the importance of the message could protect the
ambassador of either party from the vengeance of the other.</p>

<p>Some time preceding, the Ojibwas, anxious for peace, had sent a number of their
young men into these plains with a similar piece of bark, upon which they represented
their desire. This bark had been left hanging to a tree, in an exposed situation,
and had been found and taken away by a party of Sioux.</p>

<p>The proposition had been examined and discussed in the Sioux villages, and the
bark contained their answer. The Ojibwa explained to us with great facility the
intention of the Sioux.</p>

<p>The junction of the St. Peters with the Mississippi, where the principal part of the
Sioux reside, was represented, and also the American fort, with a sentinel on duty,
and a flag flying.</p>

<p>The principal Sioux chief was named The-Six, alluding, I believe, to the band of
villages under his influence. To show that he was not present at the deliberation
upon the subject of peace, he was represented on a smaller piece of bark, which
was attached to the other. To identify him, he was drawn with six heads and a
large medal. Another Sioux chief stood in the foreground, holding a pipe in his
right hand and his weapons in his left. Even we could not misunderstand that;
like our own eagle with the olive branch and arrows, he was desirous for peace, but
prepared for war.</p>

<p>The Sioux party contained fifty-nine warriors, indicated by fifty-nine guns, drawn
upon one corner of the bark.</p>

<p>The encampment of our troops had been removed from the low grounds upon the
St. Peters to a high hill upon the Mississippi. Two forts were therefore drawn upon
the bark, and the solution was not discovered until our arrival at St. Peters.</p>

<p>The effect of the discovery of the bark upon the minds of the Ojibwas was visible
and immediate.</p>

<p>The Ojibwa bark was drawn in the same general manner, and Sandy lake, the
principal place of their residence, was represented with much accuracy. To remove
any doubts respecting it, a view was given of the old northwestern establishment,
situated upon the shore, and now in the possession of the American Fur Company.</p>

<p>No proportion was preserved in their attempt at delineation. One mile of the Mississippi,
including the mouth of the St. Peters, occupied as much space as the whole
distance to Sandy Lake, nor was there anything to show that one part was nearer
to the spectator than another.</p></div>

<p>The above pictorially professed attitude of being ready for either
peace or war may be compared with the account in Champlain&mdash;Voyages
(<i>d</i>)&mdash;of the chief whose name was Mariston, but he assumed that of Mahigan
Atticq, translated as Wolf Deer. He thereby proclaimed that
when at peace he was mild as a deer, but when at war was savage as
a wolf.</p>

<p>In Davis’ Conquest of New Mexico (<i>a</i>) it is stated that Vargas’ Expedition
in 1694 was met by the Utes, who hoisted a deerskin in token
of peace.</p>

<p>The following “speech of an Ojibwa chief in negotiating a peace with
the Sioux, 1806,” from Maj. Pike’s (<i>a</i>) Expeditions, etc., shows the pictographic
use of the pipe as a profession of peace:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My father, tell the Sioux on the upper part of the river St. Peters that they mark
trees with the figure of a calumet; that we of Red lake who may go that way should
we see them, that we may make peace with them, being assured of their pacific disposition
when we shall see the calumet marked on the trees.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>D’Iberville, in 1699, as printed in Margry, <span class="smcap lowercase">IV</span>, 153, said that the
Indians met by him near the mouth of the Mississippi river indicated
their peaceful and friendly purposes by holding up in the air a small
stick of whitened wood. The same authority, in the same volume, p.
175, tells that the Oumas bore a white cross as a similar declaration;
and another journal, in the same volume, p. 239, describes a stick also
so borne as being fashioned like a pipe. The actual use of the pipe in
profession of peace and friendship is mentioned in several parts of the
present paper. See, also, the passport mentioned on p. <a href="#page214">214</a> and wampum,
p. <a href="#page225">225</a>.</p>

<p>Lieut. Col. Woodthorpe, in Jour. Anthr. Inst. Gr. Br. and I., <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span>, p.
211, says of the wild tribes of the Naga Hills, on the northeastern frontier
of India:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the road to Niao we saw on the ground a curious mud figure of a man in slight
relief presenting a gong in the direction of Senua. This was supposed to show that
the Niao men were willing to come to terms with Senua, then at war with Niao.
Another mode of evincing a desire to turn away the wrath of an approaching enemy
and induce him to open negotiations is to tie up in his path a couple of goats, sometimes
also a gong, with the universal symbol of peace, a palm leaf planted in the
ground hard by.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/dp437_pg361.png" width="500" height="329" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 470.</span>&mdash;West African message.</div>
</div>

<p>G. W. Bloxam (<i>a</i>) gives the following description of Fig. 470:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It represents a message of peace and good news from the King of Jebu to the King
of Lagos, after his restoration to the throne on the 28th of December, 1851. It appears
complicated, but the interpretation is simple enough. First we find eight
cowries arranged in pairs, and signifying the people in the four corners of the world,
and it will be observed that, while three of the pairs are arranged with their faces
upwards, the fourth and uppermost, i. e., the pair in the most important position,
are facing one another, thus signifying that the correspondents, or the people of
Jebu and Lagos, are animated by friendly feeling towards each other; so, too, there
are two each of all the other objects, meaning, “you and I,” “we two.” The two
large seeds or warres, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, express a wish that “you and I” should play together as
intimate friends do, at the game of “warre,” in which these seeds are used and which
is the common game of the country, holding very much the same position as chess or
draughts with us; the two flat seeds, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, are seeds of a sweet fruit called “osan,”
the name of which is derived from the verb, “san,” to please [Mem. Notice the
rebus] they, therefore, indicate a desire on the part of a sender of the message to
please and to be pleased; lastly, the two pieces of spice, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, signify mutual trust.
The following is the full meaning of the hieroglyphic:</p>

<p>Of all the people by which the four corners of the world are inhabited, the Lagos
and Jebu people are the nearest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>As “warre” is the common play of the country, so the Jebus and Lagos should
always play and be friendly with each other.</p>

<p>Mutual pleasantness is my desire; as it is pleasant with me so may it be pleasant
with you.</p>

<p>Deceive me not, because the spice would yield nothing else but a sweet and
genuine odor unto god. I shall never deal doubly with you.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">CHALLENGE.</span></h3>

<p>H. H. Bancroft (<i>a</i>), in Native Races, says that the Shumeias challenged
the Pomos (in central California) by placing three little sticks
notched in the middle and at both ends, on a mound which marked the
boundary between the two tribes. If the Pomos accept they tie a string
round the middle notch. Heralds then meet and arrange time and
place and the battle comes off as appointed.</p>

<p>The sending of material objects was the earliest and most natural
mode for low cultured tribes to communicate when out of sight and
hearing. Such was the system in use among the Scythians at the time
of the invasion of their land by Darius. The version of the story in
Herodotus is that commonly cited, but there is another by Pherecydes
of Heros, who relates that Idanthuras, the Scythian king, when Darius
had crossed the Ister, threatened him with war, sending him not a
letter, but a composite symbol, which consisted of a mouse, a frog, a
bird, an arrow, and a plow. When there was much discussion concerning
the meaning of this message, Orontopagas, the chiliarch, maintained
that it was a surrender; for he conjectured the mouse to mean
their dwelling, the frog their waters, the bird their air, the arrow their
arms, and the plow their country. But Xiphodres offered a contrary
interpretation, thus: “Unless like birds we fly aloft, or like mice burrow
under the ground, or like frogs take ourselves to the water, we shall
never escape their weapons, for we are not masters of their country.”</p>


<h3>SECTION 4.<br />

<span class="subhead">SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS MISSIVES.</span></h3>

<p>Fig. 471 is a letter, one-half actual size, written by an Ojibwa girl,
the daughter of a Midē', to a favored lover, requesting him to call at
her lodge. This girl had taken no Midē' degrees, but had simply
acquired her pictographic skill from observation in her home.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 471.</span>&mdash;Ojibwa love letter.</div>

<p>The explanation of the figure is as follows:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The writer of the letter, a girl of the Bear totem, as indicated by
that animal, <i>b</i>.</p>

<p><i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. The companions of <i>a</i>, the crosses signifying that the three
girls are Christians.</p>

<p><i>c</i> and <i>g</i>. The lodges occupied by the girls. The lodges are near a
large lake, <i>j</i>, a trail leading from <i>g</i> to <i>h</i>, which is a well-traveled road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter was written to a man of the Mud Puppy totem, as indicated
in <i>d</i>.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> The road leading to the lodge occupied by the recipient of the
letter.</p>

<p><i>k</i> and <i>l</i>. Lakes near which the lodges are built.</p>

<p>In examining <i>c</i>, the writer’s hand is seen protruding from an opening
to denote beckoning and to indicate which lodge to visit. The clear
indications of the locality serve as well as if in a city a young woman
had sent an invitation to her young man to call at a certain street and
number.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 472.</span>&mdash;Cheyenne letter.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 472 is a letter sent by mail from a Southern Cheyenne, named
Turtle-following-his-Wife, at the Cheyenne and Arapaho Agency, Indian
Territory, to his son Little-Man, at the Pine Ridge Agency, Dakota.
It was drawn on a half-sheet of ordinary writing paper, without a word
written, and was inclosed in an envelope, which was addressed to
“Little-Man, Cheyenne, Pine Ridge Agency,” in the ordinary manner,
written by some one at the first named agency. The letter was evidently
understood by Little-Man, as he immediately called upon Dr. V. T.
McGillycuddy, Indian agent at Pine Ridge Agency, and was aware
that the sum of $53 had been placed to his credit for the purpose of
enabling him to pay his expenses in going the long journey to his
father’s home in Indian Territory. Dr. McGillycuddy had, by the same
mail, received a letter from Agent Dyer, inclosing $53, and explaining
the reason for its being sent, which enabled him also to understand the
pictographic letter. With the above explanation it very clearly shows,
over the head of the figure to the left, the turtle following the turtle’s
wife united with the head of the figure by a line, and over the head of
the other figure, also united by a line to it, is a little man. Also over
the right arm of the last-mentioned figure is another little man in the act
of springing or advancing toward Turtle-following-his-Wife, from whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364">[364]</a></span>
mouth proceed two lines, curved or hooked at the end, as if drawing
the little figure toward him. It is suggested that the last mentioned
part of the pictograph is the substance of the communication, i. e., “come
to me,” the larger figures with their name totems being the persons addressed
and addressing. Between and above the two large figures
are fifty-three round objects intended for dollars. Both the Indian figures
have on breechcloths, corresponding with the information given
concerning them, which is that they are Cheyennes who are not all civilized
or educated.</p>

<p>Sagard (<i>a</i>) tells of the Algonkins of the Ottawa river, that when a
feast was to be given, the host sent to each person whose presence was
desired a little stick of wood, peculiar to them (i. e., probably marked
or colored) of the length and thickness of the little finger, which he
was obliged to show on entering the lodge, as might be done with a
card of invitation and admission. The precaution was seemingly
necessary both for the host’s larder and the satisfaction of the guests,
as on an occasion mentioned by the good brother, each of the guests
was provided with a big piece of sturgeon and plenty of “sagamite
huylée.” There was probably some principle of selection connected
with totems or religious societies on such occasions, not told by the
narrator, as the ordinary custom among Indians is to keep open house<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365">[365]</a></span>
to all comers, who generally were the aboriginal “tramps,” with the
result of waste and subsequent famine.</p>

<p>The Rev. Peter Jones (<i>b</i>), an educated Ojibwa missionary, in speaking
of the eastern bands of the Ojibwa says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Their method of imploring the favor or appeasing the anger of their deities is by
offering sacrifices to them in the following order: When an Indian meets with ill-luck
in hunting, or when afflictions come across his path, he fancies that by the
neglect of some duty he has incurred the displeasure of his munedoo, for which he
is angry with him; and in order to appease his wrath, he devotes the first game he
takes to making a religious feast, to which he invites a number of the principal men
and women from the other wigwams. A young man is generally sent as a messenger
to invite the guests, who carries with him a bunch of colored quills or sticks, about
4 inches long. On entering the wigwam he shouts out “Keweekomegoo;” that is,
“You are bidden to a feast.” He then distributes the quills to such as are invited;
these answer to the white people’s invitation cards. When the guests arrive at the
feast-maker’s wigwam the quills are returned to him; they are of three colors, red,
green, and white; the red for the aged, or those versed in the wahbuhnoo order; the
green for the media order, and the white for the common people.</p></div>

<p>Mr. David Boyle (<i>b</i>) refers to the above custom, and quotes Rev. Peter
Jones, also giving as illustrations copies of the quills and sticks presented
by Dr. P. E. Jones which had been brought by his father, the
author above mentioned, from the Northwest fifty years ago. These
are reproduced in Fig. 473.</p>

</div>

<p>When the ceremony of the Grand Medicine Society of the Ojibwa is
to be performed, the chief midē' priest sends out a courier to deliver to
each member an invitation to attend. These invitations consist of
sticks of cedar, or other wood when that can not be found, measuring
from 4 to 6 inches in length and of the thickness of an ordinary lead
pencil. They may be plain, though the former custom of having one
end painted red or green is sometimes continued. The colored band
is about the width of one-fifth of the length of the stick. It is stated
that in old times these invitation sticks were ornamented with colored
porcupine quills, or strands of beads, instead of with paint.</p>

<p>The courier detailed to deliver invitations is also obliged to state the
day, and locality of the place of meeting. It is necessary for the invited
member to present himself and to deposit the invitation stick upon the
floor of the inclosure in which the meeting is held; should he be deprived<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366">[366]</a></span>
of the privilege of attending, he must return the stick with an explanation
accounting for his absence.</p>

<p>Fig. 474 exhibits the sticks without coloration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>Another mode of giving invitations for the same ceremony is by
sending around a piece of birch bark bearing characters similar to
those in Fig. 475, taken from Copway, p. 136.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 475.</span>&mdash;Summons to Midē' ceremony.</div>
</div>

<p>The characters, beginning at the left hand, signify as follows: Medicine
house; great lodge; wigwam; woods; lake; river; canoe; come;
Great Spirit.</p>

<p>Copway remarks as follows:</p>

<p>“In the above, the wigwam and the medicine pale, or worship, represent
the depositories of medicine, record, and work. The lodge is
represented with men in it; the dots above indicate the number of days.</p>

<p>“The whole story would thus read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Hark to the words of the Sa-ge-mah'. The Great Medicine Lodge will be ready in
eight days. Ye who live in the woods and near the lakes and by streams of water
come with your canoes or by land to the worship of the Great Spirit.’”</p></div>

<p>The above interpretation is too much adapted to the ideas and
language of Christianity. The more simple and accurate expression
would change the rendition from “worship” and “Great
Spirit” to the simple notice about holding a session of the
Grand Medicine Society.</p>

<p>Fig. 476, drawn by a Passamaquoddy, shows how the Indians
of the tribe would now address the President of the
United States, or the governor of Maine for help, and formerly
would have made wikhegan for transmittal to a great
chief having power over them. They say by this: “You
are at the top of the pole, so no one can be higher than
you. From this pole you can see the farthest of your
country and can see all your children, and when any of
your children come to see you they must work hard to get
where you are, on top of the high pole. They must climb
up this pole to reach you. You must pity them because they
come long ways to see you, the man of power on the high
pole.” This kind of wikhegan the old men called <i>kinjemeswi
waligoh</i>, homage or salutation to the great chief. It was
always in the old time accompanied by a belt of wampum.</p>

<p>A highly interesting illustration and account of a diplomatic packet
from the pueblo of Tesuque appears in Schoolcraft (<i>g</i>), and in the same
series (<i>h</i>) is a pictograph from the Caroline islands still more in point.</p>

<p>A. W. Howitt (<i>c</i>) reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Messengers in central Australia were sent to gather people together for dances
from distances even up to 100 miles. Such messengers were painted with red ocher
and wore a headdress of feathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>In calling people together for the ceremonies of Wilyaru or Mindari the messengers
were painted with diagonal stripes of yellow ocher, and had their beards tied tightly
into a point. They carried a token shaped like a Prince of Wales feather, and made
of emu feathers tied tightly with string.</p>

<p>The sending of a handful of red ocher tied up in a small bundle signifies the great
Mindari or peace festival. In giving notice of the intention to “make some young
men” the messenger takes a handful of charcoal and places a piece in the mouth of
each person present without saying a word. This is fully understood to mean the
“making of young men” at the Wilyaru ceremony.</p></div>

<p>The following is a description of a Turkish love letter, which was
obtained by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (<i>a</i>) in 1717:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have got for you a Turkish love letter. * * * The translation of it is literally
as follows. The first piece you should pull out of the purse is a little pearl, which
must be understood in this manner:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="tdl" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>Pearl</td><td>Fairest of the young.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Clove</td><td>You are as slender as the clove.</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>I have long loved you and you have not known it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jonquil</td><td>Have pity on my passion.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Pear</td><td>Give me some hope.</td></tr>

<div class="center">
<table class="tdl" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>Pepper</td><td>Send me an answer.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>You see this letter is all in verse, and I can assure you there is as much fancy
shown in the choice of them as in the most studied expressions of our letters, there
being, I believe, a million of verses designed for this use. There is no color, no
flower, no weed, no fruit, herb, pebble, or feather that has not a verse belonging to
it; and you may quarrel, reproach, or send letters of passion, friendship, or civility,
or even of news without ever inking your fingers.</p></div>

<p>The use by Turks and Persians of flower letters or communications,
the significance of which is formed by the selection and arrangement
of flowers, is well known. A missive thus composed of flowers is called
sélam, but the details are too contradictory and confused to furnish
materials for an accurate dictionary of the flower language, though
dictionaries and treatises on it have been published. (See Magnat.)
Individual fancy and local convention, it seems, fix the meanings.</p>

<p>A Japanese girl who decides to discourage the further attentions of
a lover sends to him, instead of the proverbial “mitten” of New England,
a sprig of maple, because the leaf changes its color more markedly than
any other. In this connection it is told that the Japanese word for love
also means color, which would accentuate the lesson of the changing leaf.</p>

<h4>MESSAGE STICKS.</h4>

<p>The following extracts are made from Curr’s (<i>a</i>) Australian Race:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I believe every tribe in Australia has its messenger, whose life, whilst he is in the
performance of his duties, is held sacred in peace and war by the neighboring tribes.
His duties are to convey the messages which the tribe desires to send to its neighbors,
and to make arrangements about places of meeting on occasions of fights or
corroborees. In many tribes it is the custom to supply the messenger when he sets
out with a little carved stick, which he delivers with his message to the most influential
man of the tribe to which he is sent. This carved stick he often carries whilst
traveling stuck in the netted band which the blacks wear round the head. I have
seen many of them, and been present when they were received and sent, and have
some from Queensland in my possession at present. They are often flat, from 4 to 6
inches long, an inch wide, and a third of an inch thick; others are round, of the
same length, and as thick as one’s middle finger. When flat their edges are often
notched, and their surface always more or less carved with indentations, transverse
lines, and squares; in fact, with the same sort of figures with which the blacks
ornament their weapons throughout the continent; when round, fantastic lines are
cut around them or lengthwise. I have one before me at this moment which is a
miniature boomerang, carved on both sides, notched at the edges, and colored with
red ocher. Any black could fashion sticks of this sort in an hour or two. Some of
my correspondents have spoken of them as a sort of writing, but when pressed on
the subject have admitted that their surmise, all the circumstances weighed, was
not tenable. The flat sticks especially have that sort of regularity and repetition
of pattern which wall papers exhibit. That they do not serve the purpose of writing
or hieroglyphics I have no hesitation in asserting; and I may remark that in all
cases which have come under my notice the messenger delivered his message before
he presented the carved stick. That done the recipient would attempt to explain to
those about him how the stick portrayed the message. Still this eminently childish
proceeding leads one to consider whether the most savage mind does not contain the
germ of writing. Bernal Diaz del Castillo, in his Discovery and Conquest of New
Spain, relates that, when his country sent verbal messages by Mexican bearers to
distant tribes, the messengers who had seen the Spaniards write always asked to be
supplied with a letter, which, of course, neither they nor the people to whom they
were sent could read.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 477 reproduces the illustration of the message sticks published
in the work above mentioned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, p. 306.&mdash;In the Majanna tribe messengers are sent with a notched or carved
stick, and the bearer has to explain its meaning. If it be a challenge to fight, and
the challenge is accepted, another stick is returned.</p>

<p>Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>, p. 183.&mdash;The bearer of an important communication from one party to another
often carries a message stick with him, the notches and lines on which he refers to
whilst delivering his message. This custom, which prevails from the north coast to
the south, is a very curious one. No black fellow ever pretends to be able to understand
a message from a notched stick, but always looks upon it as confirmatory of
the message it accompanies.</p>

<p>Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>, p. 427.&mdash;Message sticks are in use, the marks carved on them being a guaranty
of the messenger, the same as a ring with us in former times.</p>

<p>Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span>, p. 263.&mdash;Message sticks are used by the Maranoa river tribe. An informant
has in his possession a reed necklace attached to a piece of flat wood about 5
inches long; on the wood are carved straight and curved lines, and this piece of
wood was sent by one portion of the tribe to another by a messenger, the two parties
being about 60 miles apart. The interpretation of the carving was: “My wife
has been stolen; we shall have to fight; bring your spears and boomerangs.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370">[370]</a></span>
straight lines, it was explained, meant spears and the curved ones boomerangs; but
the stealing of the wife seems to have been left to the messenger to tell.</p></div>

<p>A. W. Howitt (<i>a</i>) gives a further account on this topic:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The messenger carries with him as the emblems of his missions a complete set of
male attire, together with the sacred humming instrument, which is wrapped in a
skin and carefully concealed from women and children. It is, therefore, in such
cases, the totem which assembles the whole community.</p>

<p>In the Adjadura tribe of South Australia the ceremonies are ordered to be held by
the headman of the whole tribe by his messenger, who carries a message stick
marked in such a manner that it serves to illustrate his message; together with this
there is also sent a sacred humming instrument.</p></div>

<p>Drs. Houzé and Jacques (<i>a</i>) give a different view of the significance
of the marks on message sticks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It proves very difficult to discover the signification of the notched message sticks.
The Europeans have not succeeded in deciphering them. Some marks may represent
a whole history. The following anecdote on this subject is reported by M.
Cauvin (according to J. M. Davis, Aborigines of Victoria, v. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, p. 356, note): A European,
having formed the project of establishing a new station, started from Edward
river with a herd of cattle and some Indians. When, all being arranged, the colonist
was on the point of returning home, one of the young blacks requested him to
take a letter to his father, and, on the consent of his patron, he gave him a stick
about a foot long covered with notches and signs. On arriving home the colonist
went to the camp of the blacks and delivered the letter to the father of his young
follower, who, calling around him the whole encampment, to the great surprise of
the European, read from this stick a daily account of the doings of the company
from the departure from Edward river until the arrival at the new station, describing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371">[371]</a></span>
the country which they had traversed and the places where they had camped
each night.</p></div>

<p>The Queenslanders did not give Drs. Houzé and Jacques such a long
translation of their message sticks, but they informed them that one of
the sticks related to the crossing from Australia into America, which is
recounted by Tambo, the author of the message. An illustration of it
is presented on p. 93 of the above cited work of Houzé and Jacques, but
is not sufficiently distinct for reproduction.</p>


<h4>WEST AFRICAN AROKO.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/dp447_pg371a.png" width="400" height="225" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 478.</span>&mdash;West African aroko.</div>
</div>

<p>G. W. Bloxam (<i>b</i>) says of the aroko, or symbolic letters, used by the
tribe of Jebu, in West Africa, describing Fig. 478:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a message from a native general of the Jebu force to a native prince
abroad. It consists of six cowries. Six in the Jebu language is E-fà, which is derived
from the verb fà, to draw. They are arranged
two and two, face to face, on a long string;
the pairs of cowries set face to face indicate friendly
feeling and good fellowship; the number expresses
a desire to draw close to the person to whom the
message is sent [note the rebus]; while the long
string indicates considerable distance or a long
road. This is the message: “Although the road
between us be very long, yet I draw you to myself
and set my face towards you. So I desire you to set your face towards me and
draw to me.”</p></div>

<p>On p. 298 he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the Jebu in West Africa odd numbers in their message are of evil import,
while even numbers express good will. Thus a single cowrie may be sent as an unfavorable
answer to a request or message.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/dp447_pg371b.png" width="550" height="312" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 479.</span>&mdash;West African aroko.</div>
</div>

<p>The same author writes, on p. 297, describing Fig. 479:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a message from His Majesty Awnjale, the King of Jebu, to his nephew abroad;
and here we find other substances besides cowries included in the aroko. Taking
the various articles in order, commencing from the knot, we observe four cowries
facing in the same direction, with their backs to the knot; this signifies agreement.
Next a piece of spice, <i>a</i>, which produces when burnt a sweet odor and is never unpleasant;
then come three cowries facing in the same direction; then a piece of mat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372">[372]</a></span>
<i>b</i>; then a piece of feather, <i>c</i>; and, lastly, a single cowrie turned in the same direction
as all the others. The interpretation is:</p>

<p>“Your ways agree with mine very much. Your ways are pleasing to me and I
like them.</p>

<p>“Deceive me not, because the spice would yield nothing else but a sweet and genuine
odor unto God.</p>

<p>“I shall never deal doubly with you all my life long.</p>

<p>“The weight of your words to me is beyond all description.</p>

<p>“As it is on the same family mat we have been sitting and lying down together, I
send to you.</p>

<p>“I am, therefore, anxiously awaiting and hoping to hear from you.”</p></div>

<p>The following account of “African Symbolic Messages,” condensed
from the paper of the Rev. C. A. Gollmer, which appeared in Jour.
Anthrop. Inst. of Gr. Bn. and I., <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV</span>, p. 169, et. seq., is highly interesting
as showing the ideography attached to the material objects transmitted.
The step in evolution by which the graphic delineation of
those objects was substituted for their actual presence was probably
delayed only by the absence of convenient material, such as birch bark,
parchment, or other portable rudimentary form of paper on which to
draw or paint, or at least by the want of a simple invention for the
application of such material:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The natives in the Yoruba country, West Africa, in the absence of writing, and as
a substitute for it, send to one another messages by means of a variety of tangible
objects, such as shells, feathers, pepper, corn, stone, coal, sticks, powder, shot, razors,
etc., through which they convey their ideas, feelings, and wishes, good and bad, and
that in an unmistakable manner. The object transmitted is seen, the import of it
known and the message verbally delivered by the messenger sent, and repeated by
one or more other persons accompanying the messenger for the purpose as the importance
of the message is considered to require.</p>

<p>Cowry shells in the symbolic language are used to convey, by their number and
the way in which they are strung, a variety of ideas. One cowry may indicate
“defiance and failure;” thus: A cowry (having a small hole made at the back part,
so as to be able to pass a string through it and the front opening) strung on a short
bit of grass fiber or cord, and sent to a person known as a rival, or one aiming at
injuring the other, the message is: “As one finger can not take up a cowry (more
than one are required), so you one I defy; you will not be able to hurt me, your evil
intentions will come to nothing.”</p>

<p>Two cowries may indicate “relationship and meeting;” thus: Two cowries strung
together, face to face, and sent to an absent brother or sister, the message is: “We
are children of one mother, were nursed by the same breasts.”</p>

<p>Two cowries may indicate “separation and enmity;” thus: Two cowries strung
back to back and sent to a person gone away, the message is: “You and I are now
separated.”</p>

<p>Two cowries and a feather may indicate “speedy meeting;” thus: Two cowries
strung face to face, with a small feather (of a chicken or other bird) tied between
the two cowries, and sent to a friend at a distance, the message is: “I want to see
you, as the bird (represented by the feather) flies straight and quickly, so come as
quickly as you can.”</p>

<p>The following fivefold painful symbolic message was sent by D., whilst in captivity
at Dahomey, to his wife, who happened to be staying with Mr. Gollmer, at
Badagry, at the time. The symbols were a stone, a coal, a pepper, corn, and a rag.
During the attack of the King of Dahomey, with his great army of Amazons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373">[373]</a></span>
other soldiers, upon Abeokuta in March, 1852, D., one of the native Christians and
defenders of his town, home, and family, was taken captive and carried to Dahomey,
where he suffered much for a long time. Whilst waiting for weeks to know the
result his wife received the symbolic letter which conveyed the following message:</p>

<p>The stone indicated “health” (the stone was a small, common one from the street);
thus the message was: “As the stone is hard, so my body is hardy, strong&mdash;i. e., well.”</p>

<p>The coal indicated “gloom” (the coal was a small piece of charcoal); thus the
message was: “As the coal is black, so are my prospects dark and gloomy.”</p>

<p>The pepper indicated “heat” (the pepper was of the hot cayenne sort); thus the
message was: “As the pepper is hot so is my mind heated, burning on account of
the gloomy prospect&mdash;i. e., not knowing what day I may be sold or killed.”</p>

<p>The corn indicated “leanness” (the corn was a few parched grains of maize or
Indian corn); thus the message was: “As the corn is dried up by parching; so my
body is dried up or become lean through the heat of my affliction and suffering.”</p>

<p>The rag indicated “worn out;” thus (the rag was a small piece of worn and torn
native cloth, in which the articles were wrapped) the message was: “As the rag is,
so is my cloth cover&mdash;i. e., native dress, worn and torn to a rag.”</p>

<p>A tooth brush may indicate “remembrance;” thus: It is a well-known fact that
the Africans in general can boast of a finer and whiter set of teeth than most other
nations. And those Europeans who lived long among them know from constant
observation how much attention they pay to their teeth, not only every morning,
but often during the day. The tooth brush made use of is simply a piece of wood
about 6 to 9 inches long, and of the thickness of a finger. One end of the stick,
wetted with the saliva, is rubbed to and fro against the teeth, which end after
awhile becomes soft. This sort of tooth brush is frequently given to friends as an
acceptable present, and now and then it is made use of as a symbolic letter, and in such
a case the message is: “As I remember my teeth the first thing in the morning, and
often during the day, so I remember and think of you as soon as I get up, and often
afterwards.”</p>

<p>Sugar may indicate “peace and love;” in the midst of a war this good disposition
was made known from one party to another by the following symbol: A loaf of
white sugar was sent by messengers from the native church at A. to the native
church at I., and the message was: “As the sugar is white, so there is no blackness
(i. e., enmity) in our hearts towards you; our hearts are white (i. e., pure and free
from it). And as the sugar is sweet, so there is no bitterness among us against you;
we are sweet (i. e., at peace with you) and love you.”</p>

<p>A fagot may indicate “fire and destruction;” when a fagot (i. e., a small bundle
of bamboo poles, burnt on one end) is found fastened to the bamboo fence inclosing
a compound, or premises, it conveys the message: “Your house will be burnt
down”&mdash;i. e., destroyed.</p>

<p>Powder and shot are often made use of and sent as a symbolic letter; the message
is to either an individual or a people, viz: “As we can not settle the quarrel, we
must fight it out” (i. e., “we shall shoot you, or make war upon you”).</p>

<p>A razor may indicate “murder.” A person suspected and accused of having by
some means or other been the cause of death of a member of a family, the representative
of that family will demand satisfaction by sending the symbolic objects, viz, a
razor or knife, which is laid outside the door of the house of the accused offender
and guilty party, and the message is well understood to be: “You have killed or
caused the death of N., you must kill yourself to avenge his death.”</p></div>

<p>The following examples indicate a still further step in evolution by
which the names of the objects or of the numbers are of the same sound
as words in the language the significance of which constitutes the real
message. This objective rebus corresponds with the pictorial rebus so
common in Mexican pictographs, and which is well known to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374">[374]</a></span>
borne a chief part in the development of Egyptian and other ancient
forms of writing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Three cowries with some pepper may indicate “deceit;” thus: Three cowries
strung with their faces all looking one way (as mentioned before) with an alligator
pepper tied to the cowries. Eru is the name of the pepper in the native language,
which in English means “deceit.” The message may be either a “caution not to
betray one another,” or, more frequently, an accusation of having deceived and defrauded
the company.</p>

<p>Six cowries may indicate “attachment and affection;” thus: Efa in the native
language means “six” (cowries implied); it also means “drawn,” from the verb fa,
to draw. Mora is always implied as connected with Efa; this means “stick to you,”
from the verb mo, to stick to, and the noun ara, body&mdash;i. e. you. Six cowries
strung (as before mentioned) and sent to a person or persons, the message is: “I am
drawn (i. e. attached) to you, I love you,” which may be the message a young man
sends to a young woman with a desire to form an engagement.</p></div>

<p>Rev. Richard Taylor (<i>b</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Maori used a kind of hieroglyphical or symbolical way of communication; a
chief, inviting another to join in a war party, sent a tattooed potato and a fig of
tobacco bound up together, which was interpreted to mean that the enemy was a
Maori and not European by the tattoo, and by the tobacco that it represented
smoke; he therefore roasted the one and eat it, and smoked the other, to show he accepted
the invitation, and would join him with his guns and powder. Another sent a
waterproof coat with the sleeves made of patchwork, red, blue, yellow, and green,
intimating that they must wait until all the tribes were united before their force
would be waterproof, i. e., able to encounter the European. Another chief sent a
large pipe, which would hold a pound of tobacco, which was lighted in a large
assembly, the emissary taking the first whiff, and then passing it around; whoever
smoked it showed that he joined in the war.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">CLAIM OR DEMAND.</span></h3>

<p>Stephen Powers (<i>b</i>) states that the Nishinam of California have the
following mode of collecting debts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When an Indian owes another, it is held to be in bad taste, if not positively insulting,
for the creditor to dun the debtor, as the brutal Saxon does, so he devises a
more subtle method. He prepares a certain number of little sticks, according to
the amount of the debt, and paints a ring around the end of each. These he carries
and tosses into the delinquent’s wigwam without a word and goes his way; whereupon
the other generally takes the hint, pays the debt, and destroys the sticks.</p></div>

<p>The San Francisco (California) Western Lancet, <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span>, 1882, p. 443,
thus reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When a patient has neglected to remunerate the shaman [of the Wikehumni tribe
of the Mariposan linguistic stock] for his services, the latter prepares short sticks

only, and every time he passes the delinquent’s lodge a certain number of them are
thrown in as a reminder of the indebtedness.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="subhead">TOTEMS, TITLES, AND NAMES.</span></h2>


<p>The employment of pictographs to designate tribes, groups within
tribes, and individual persons has been the most frequent of all the
uses to which they have been applied. Indeed, the constant need
that devices to represent the terms styled by grammarians proper
names should be readily understood for identification has, more than
any other cause, maintained and advanced pictography as an art, and
in some parts of the world has evolved from it syllabaries and afterwards
alphabets. From the same origin came heraldry, which in time
designated with absolute accuracy persons and families for the benefit
of letterless people. Trade-marks have the same history.</p>

<p>From the earliest times men have used emblems to indicate their
tribes or clans. Homer makes no clear allusion to their manifestation
at the poetic siege of Troy; but even if his Greeks did not bear them,
other nations of the period did. The earlier Egyptians carried images
of bulls and crocodiles into battle, probably at first with religious sentiments.
Each of the twelve tribes of Israel had a special ensign of its
own, which is now generally considered to have been totemic. The
subjects of Semiramis adopted doves and pigeons as their token in
deference to their queen, whose name meant “dove.”</p>

<p>At later dates Athens chose an owl for her sign, as a compliment to
Minerva; Corinth, a winged horse, in memory of Pegasus and his
fountain; Carthage, a horse’s head, in homage to Neptune; Persia, the
sun, because its people worshiped fire; Rome, an eagle, in deference
to Jupiter. These objects appear to have been carved in wood or metal.
There is no evidence of anything resembling modern flags, except, perhaps,
in parts of Asia, until the Romans began to use something like
them about the time of Cæsar. But these small signs had no national
or public character so as to be comparable with the eagles on the Roman
standard; nor was any floating banner associated with ruling
power until Constantine gave a religious meaning to the labarum.</p>

<p>Emblems also were often adopted by political and religious parties,
e. g., the cornstalks and slings of the Mazarinists and anti-Mazarinists
during the Fronde, the caps and hats in the Swedish diet in 1788, the
scarf of the Armagnacs, and the cross of the Burgundians. The topic
of emblems is further discussed in Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page583">XVIII</a></span>.</p>

<p>As with increased culture clans and tribes have become nations,
so there has been an evolution by which the ensigns of bands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377">[377]</a></span>
orders have been discontinued and replaced by the emblems of
nationalities. Frederic Marshall (<i>a</i>) well says: “Images of animals,
badges, war cries, cockades, liveries, coats of arms, tokens, tattooing,
are all replaced practically by national ensigns.” This change is
toward the higher and nobler significance and employment, all members
of the community being protected and designated by the simple
exhibition of a single emblem.</p>

<p>This chapter is naturally divided into (1) Pictorial tribal designations,
(2) Gentile and clan designations, (3) Significance of tattoo, (4)
Designations of individuals.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">PICTORIAL TRIBAL DESIGNATIONS.</span></h3>

<p>Capt. de Lamothe Cadillac (<i>a</i>) writing in the year 1696 of the Algonquians
of the Great Lake region near Mackinac, etc., describes the
emblems on their canoes as follows: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On y voit la natte de guerre le
corbeau, l’ours on quelque autre animal * * * estant l’esprit qui
doit conduire cette enterprise.</span>”</p>

<p>This, however, was a mistake as applicable to the time when it was
written. The animals used as emblems may originally have been regarded
as supernatural totemic beings, but had probably become tribal
designations.</p>


<h4>IROQUOIAN TRIBAL DESIGNATIONS.</h4>

<p>Bacqueville de la Potherie (<i>c</i>) says that a treaty with the French in
Canada, about 1700, was “sealed” with the “proper arms,” pictorially
drawn, of the Indian tribes which were parties to it. The following is
a copy of the original statement in its archaic form:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Callieres, de Champigni, &amp; de Vaudreüil, en signerent le Traité, que
chaque Nation scella de ses propres armes. Les Tsonnontouans &amp; les Onnontaguez
designerent une araignée, le Goyogouin un calumet, les Onneyouts un morceau de
bois en fourche, une pierre au milieu, un Onnontagué mit un Ours pour les Aniez,
quoi qu’ils ne vinrent pas. Le Rat mit un Castor, les Abenaguis un Chevreüil, les
Outaouaks un Liévre, ainsi des autres.</p></div>

<p>From this it appears <span class="lock">that&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Seneca and Onondaga tribes were represented by a “spider.”
[This was doubtless a branching tree, so badly drawn as to be mistaken
for a spider.]</p>

<p>The Cayuga tribe, by a calumet.</p>

<p>The Oneida tribe, by a forked stick with a stone in the fork. [The
forked stick was really designed for the fork of a tree.]</p>

<p>The Mohawk tribe, by a bear.</p>

<p>Le Rat, who was a representative Huron of Mackinaw, by a beaver.</p>

<p>The Abnaki, by a deer.</p>

<p>The Ottawa, by a hare.</p>

<p>Several other accounts of the tribal signs of the Iroquois are published,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378">[378]</a></span>
often with illustrations, e. g., in Documents relating to the Colonial
History of New York (<i>a</i>), with the following remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When they go to war, and wish to inform those of the party who may pass their
path, they make a representation of the animal of their tribe, with a hatchet in his
dexter paw; sometimes a saber or a club; and if there be a number of tribes together
of the same party, each draws the animal of his tribe, and their number, all
on a tree, from which they remove the bark. The animal of the tribe which heads
the expedition is always the foremost.</p></div>

<p>Another account of interest, which does not appear to have been
published, was traced and contributed by Mr. William Young, of Philadelphia.
It is a deed from the representatives of the Six Nations (the
Tuscaroras then being admitted) to the King of Great Britain, dated
November 4, 1768, and recorded at the recorder’s office, Philadelphia,
in Deed Book <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, vol. 5, p. 241. Nearly all of these accounts and illustrations
are confused and imperfect. An instructive blunder occurs in
the translated signature representing the Mohawk tribe in the above
mentioned deed. It is called “The Steel,” which could hardly have
been an ancient tribal name, but after study it was remembered that
the Mohawks have sometimes been called by a name properly translated
the “Flint people.” By some confusion about flint and steel,
which were still used in the middle of the last century to produce sparks
of fire, perhaps assisted by the pantomime of striking those objects
together, the one intended to be indicated, viz, the flint, was understood
to be the other, the steel, and so these words were written under
the figure, which was so roughly drawn that it might have been taken
for a piece of flint or of steel or, indeed, anything else.</p>


<h4>EASTERN ALGONQUIAN TRIBAL DESIGNATIONS.</h4>

<p>The illustrations in Fig. 483 were drawn in 1888 by a Passamaquoddy
Indian, in Maine, near the Canada border. The Passamaquoddy, Penobscot,
and Amalecite are tribal divisions of the Abnaki, who formerly
were also called Tarrateens by the more southern New England
tribes and Owenunga by the Iroquois. The Micmacs are congeners of
the Abnaki, but not classed in their tribal divisions. All the four
tribes belong to the Algonquian linguistic stock.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/dp455_pg379h.png">
<img src="images/dp455_pg379.png" class="hires" width="500" height="209" alt="" />
</a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 483.</span>&mdash;Eastern Algonquian tribal designations.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 483 <i>a</i> is the tribal emblem of the Passamaquoddy. It shows two
Indians in a canoe, both using paddles and not poles, following a fish,
the pollock. The variation which will appear in the represented use
of poles and paddles in the marks of the Algonquian tribes in Maine,
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, etc., is said to have originated in the
differing character of the waters, shoal or deep, sluggish or rapid, of
the regions of the four bodies of Indians whose totems are indicated as
next follows, thus requiring the use of pole and paddle, respectively, in
a greater or less degree. The animals figured are in all cases repeated
consistently by each one of the several delineators, and in all cases
there is some device to show a difference between the four canoes, either
in their structure or in their mode of propulsion, but these devices are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379">[379]</a></span>
not always consistent. It is therefore probable that the several animals
designated constitute the true and ancient totemic emblems, and that
the accompaniment of the canoes is a modern differentiation.</p>

<p><i>b</i> The Maresquite or Amalecite emblem. Two Indians in a canoe,
both with poles, following a muskrat.</p>

<p><i>c</i> The Micmac emblem. Two Indians, both with paddles, in a canoe
built with high middle parts familiarly called “humpback,” following a
deer.</p>

<p><i>d</i> The Penobscot emblem. Two Indians in a canoe, one with a paddle
and the other with a pole, following an otter.</p>

<p>In Margry (<i>a</i>) is an account, written about 1722, of the “Principal
divisions of the Sioux and their distinctive marks,” thus translated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are from twenty to twenty-six villages of Scioux and they comprise the
nations of the prairies:</p>

<p>(1) The Ouatabatonha, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scioux des Rivières</span>, living on the St. Croix river or
Lake de la Folle-Avoine which is below, and 15 leagues from the Serpent river.
Their distinctive sign is a bear wounded in the neck.</p>

<p>(2) The Menesouhatoba, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scioux des Lacs</span>, having for their mark a bear wounded
in the neck.</p>

<p>(3) The Matatoba, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scioux des Prairies</span>, having for their mark a fox with an
arrow in its mouth.</p>

<p>(4) The Hictoba, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scioux de la Chasse</span>, having for their symbol the elk.</p>

<p>(5) The Titoba, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scioux des Prairies</span>, whose emblem is the deer. It bears a bow
on its horns.</p>

<p>We have as yet had no commerce save with five nations. The Titoba live 80
leagues west of Sault Saint-Antoine.</p></div>

<p>The above early, though meager, notice will serve as an introduction
to the following series of pictorial tribal signs, all drawn by Sioux
Indians, and many of them representing tribal divisions of the Siouan
linguistic stock. The history and authority of the several “Winter
Counts” mentioned are referred to supra, chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X</span>, section <a href="#page266">2</a>. Red-Cloud’s
census and the Oglala roster are also described below. Explanations
of some figures are added which have no reference to the
present topic, but which seemed necessary and could not be separated
and transferred to more appropriate division without undue multiplication
of figures and text.</p>

<h5>ABSAROKA OR CROW.</h5>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 484.</span>&mdash;Absaroka.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 484.&mdash;Dakota and Crow, Cloud-Shield’s Winter Count, 1819-’20.
In an engagement between the Dakotas and the Crows both sides
expended all of their arrows, and then threw dirt at each other. A
Crow is represented on the right, and
is distinguished by the manner in
which the hair is worn. Hidatsa
and Absaroka are represented with
striped or spotted hair, which denotes
the red clay they apply to it.</p>

<p>The custom which prevails among
these tribes, and is said to have originated
with the Crows, is to wear a
wig of horse hair attached to the
occiput, thus resembling the natural
growth, but much increased in length.
These wigs are made in strands having the thickness of a finger, varying
from eight to fifteen in number, and held apart and in place by means of
thin cross strands, thus resembling coarse network. At every intersection
of strands of hair and crossties, lumps of pine gum are attached
to prevent disarrangement and as in itself ornamental, and to these
lumps dry vermilion clay is applied by the richer classes and red ocher
or powdered clay by the poorer people.</p>

<p>Pictures drawn by some of the northern tribes of the Dakota show
the characteristic and distinctive features for a Crow Indian to be the
distribution of the red war paint which covers the forehead.</p>

<p>Fig. 485.&mdash;Cloud-Shield’s Winter Count, 1830-’31. The Crows were
approaching a village at a time when there was a great deal of snow
on the ground and intended to surprise it, but, some herders
discovering them, the Dakotas went out, laid in wait for
the Crows, surprised them, and killed many. A Crow’s
head is represented in the figure.</p>

<p>The Crow is designated not only by the arrangement of
back hair, before mentioned, but by a topknot of hair extending
upward from the forehead, brushed upward and
slightly backward. See also the seated figure in the record of Running
Antelope, in Fig. <a href="#page574">820</a>, infra.</p>

winter,” also “Much corn winter.”</p>

<p>The gun and the arrow in contact with the ear of corn
show that both whites and Indians fought the Rees. The
ear of corn signifies “Ree” or Arikara Indians, who are
designated in gesture language as “corn shellers.”</p>

the musk ox, and the device is the outline of the vocal
organs, according to the Dakota concept, and represents
the upper lip and roof of the mouth, the tongue, the lower lip, and chin
and neck. The view is lateral, and resembles the sectional aspect of
the mouth and tongue.</p>

him. Cloud-Shield’s Winter Count, 1808-’10.</p>

<p>Again the burnt thigh is suggested by the black spot.</p>

<p>The significance of these two figures is explained by
the gesture sign for Brulé as follows: Rub the upper
and outer part of the right thigh in a small circle with
the open right hand, fingers pointing downward. These
Indians were once caught in a prairie fire, many burned
to death, and others badly burned about the thighs;
hence the name Si-ca<sup>n</sup>-gu, burnt thigh, and the sign.
According to the Brulé chronology, this fire occurred in
1763, which they call “The-people-were-burned winter.”</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 495.</span>&mdash;Cheyenne.</div>
</div>

<p>The marks on the arm constitute the
tribal pictographic emblem. It is explained
by the gesture sign as follows: Pass the
ulnar side of the extended index finger
repeatedly across extended finger and back
of the left hand. Fig. 495 illustrates this
gesture sign. Frequently, however, the index
is drawn across the wrist or forearm, or
the extended index, palm upward, is drawn
across the forefinger of the left hand (palm
inward), several times, left hand stationary, right hand is drawn toward
the body until the index
is drawn clear off; then
repeat. Some Cheyennes believe
this to have reference
to the former custom of cutting
the arms as offerings to
spirits, while others think it refers to a more ancient custom of cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383">[383]</a></span>
off the enemy’s fingers for necklaces, and sometimes to cutting off the
whole hand or forearm as a trophy to be displayed as scalps more generally
are.</p>

Winter Count, 1775-’76. He carried home with him
a pine tree of a species he had never seen before. In
this count the Dakotas are usually distinguished by
the braided scalp lock and the feather they wear at
the crown of the head, or by the manner in which
they brush back and tie the hair with ornamented
strips. Many illustrations are given in the present
paper in which this arrangement of the hair is shown
more distinctly.</p>

<p>With regard to the designation of this tribe by
paint it seems that pictures made by the northern Dakotas represent
themselves as distinguished from other Indians by being painted red
from below the eyes to the end of the chin. But this is probably rather
a special war painting than a tribal design.</p>

blood on the ice, and killed is expressed by a blood-tipped

winter.” The tomahawk with which it was
done is in contact with the Kaiowa’s head.</p>

<p>The sign for Kaiowa is sometimes made by passing
one or both hands, naturally extended, in short horizontal
circles on either side of the head, together
with a shaking motion, the conception being “rattle-brained”
or “crazy heads.” The picture is drawn to
represent the man in the attitude of making this gesture, and not the
involuntary raising of the hands upon receiving the blow, such attitudes
not appearing in Battiste Good’s system.</p>

<p>In this connection it is useful to quote Dunbar (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The tribal mark of the Pawnees in their pictographic or historic painting was the
scalp lock dressed to stand nearly erect or curving slightly backwards, somewhat
like a horn. This, in order that it should retain its position, was filled with vermillion
or other pigment, and sometimes lengthened by means of a tuft of horse hair
skillfully appended so as to form a trail back over the shoulders. This usage was
undoubtedly the origin of the name Pawnee. * * * It is most probably derived
from <i>pá-rĭk-ĭ</i>, a horn, and seems to have been once used by the Pawnees themselves to
designate their peculiar scalp lock. From the fact that this was the most noticeable
feature in their costume, the name came naturally to be the denominative term of
the tribe.</p></div>

tracks are used for horses. Attack is indicated by marks which represent
bullet marks, and which convey the idea that the bullet struck.

<h5>SHOSHONI.</h5>

<p>Dr. George Gibbs (<i>b</i>) describes a pictograph made by one of the
Indian tribes of Oregon and Washington, upon which “the figure of a
man with a long queue or scalp lock reached to his heels denoted a Shoshoni,
that tribe being in the habit of braiding horse or other hair into
their own in that manner.”</p>

<p>This may be correct regarding the Shoshoni Indians among the
extreme northwestern tribes, but the mark of identification could not be
based upon the custom of braiding with their own hair that of animals, to
increase the length and appearance of the queue, as this custom also prevails
among the Absaroka, Hidatsa, and Arikaa Indians, respectively,
as before mentioned in this work.</p>

<p>Tanner’s Narrative (<i>e</i>) gives additional information on this topic
regarding the absence of any tribal sign in connection with a human
figure.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The men of the same tribe are extensively acquainted with the totems which belong
to each, and if on any record of this kind the figure of a man appears without
any designatory mark, it is immediately understood that he is a Sioux or at least a
stranger. Indeed, in most instances the figures of men are not used at all, merely
the totem or surname, being given. * * * It may be observed that the Algonkins
believe all other Indians to have totems, though from the necessity they are
in general under of remaining ignorant of those hostile bands, the omission of the
totem in their picture writing serves to designate an enemy. Thus, those bands of
Ojibbeways who border on the country of the Dahcotah or Sioux, always understand
the figure of a man without totem to mean one of that people.</p></div>

<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">GENTILE AND CLAN DESIGNATIONS.</span></h3>

<p>The clan and totemic system formerly called the gentile system undoubtedly
prevailed anciently in Europe and Asia, but first became
understood by observations of its existence in actual force among the
aborigines of America and Australia, and typical representations of it
are still found among them. In Australia it is called kobong. An animal
or a plant, or sometimes a heavenly body was mythologically at first
and at last sociologically connected with all persons of a certain stock,
who believe, or once believed, that it was their tutelar god and they
bear its name.</p>

<p>Each clan or gens took as a badge or objective totem the representation
of the tutelar daimon from which it was named. As most Indian
tribes were zootheistic, the object of their devotion was generally an
animal&mdash;e. g., an eagle, a panther, a buffalo, a bear, a deer, a raccoon, a
tortoise, a snake, or a fish, but sometimes was one of the winds, a celestial
body, or other impressive object or phenomenon.</p>

<p>American Indians once generally observed a prohibition against killing
the animal connected with their totem or eating any part of it.
For instance, most of the southern Indians abstained from killing the
wolf; the Navajo do not kill bears; the Osage never killed the beaver
until the skins became valuable for sale. Afterward some of the animals
previously held sacred were killed; but apologies were made to
them at the time, and in almost all cases the prohibition or taboo survived
with regard to certain parts of those animals which were not to
be eaten on the principle of synecdoche, the temptation to use the food
being too strong to permit entire abstinence. The Cherokee forbade the
use of the tongues of the deer and bear for food. They cut these members
out and cast them into the fire sacramentally. A practice still
exists among the Ojibwa as follows: There is a formal restriction
against members of the bear clan eating the animal, yet by a subdivision
within the same clan an arrangement is made so that sub-clans
may among them eat the whole animal. When a bear is killed, the
head and paws are eaten by those who form one branch of the bear
totem, and the remainder is reserved for the others. Other Indian
tribes have invented a differentiation in which some clansmen may
eat the ham and not the shoulder of certain animals, and others the
shoulder and not the ham.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that sometimes the whole animal is designated
as a clan totem, and also that sometimes only parts of it is selected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389">[389]</a></span>
Many of the devices given in this paper under the heading of personal
names have this origin. The following figures show a selection of parts
of animals that may further illustrate the subject. It must, however,
be borne in mind that some of the cases may be connected with individual
visions or with personal adventures and not directly with the
clan system. In the absence of detailed information in each instance
discrimination is impossible.</p>

<p>Schoolcraft says that the Ojibwa always placed the totemic or clan<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390">[390]</a></span>
pictorial mark upon the <i>adjedatig</i> or grave-post, thereby sinking the
personal name which is not generally indicative of the totem. The
same practice is found in other tribes. The Pueblos depict the gentile
or totemic pictorial sign upon their various styles of ceramic work.</p>

<p>The author says that these uprights are always carved according to
the crest of the gens of the house owner, and represent men standing
on the heads of animals. This use of the term “crest” is not heraldically
correct, as literally it would require the men to be standing on
the coverings of their own heads, but the idea is plain, the word being
used for a device similar in nature and significance to the crest in
heraldry, and it was adopted by the ancestors of the Kwakiutl gentes in
relation to certain exploits that they had made. Both human figures
show painting and probably also tattooing on their faces.</p>

<p>The character on the left hand also shows a design on the breast.
That on the right hand presents a curious artifice of carving by which
the legs and an arm are exhibited while preserving the solidity of the
upright.</p>


<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">SIGNIFICANCE OF TATTOO.</span></h3>

<p>Tattooing proper is a permanent marking of the skin accomplished
by the introduction of coloring matter under the cutaneous epidermis.
In popular expression and often in literature it includes penetration
of the skin by cuts, gashes, or sometimes burns, without the insertion
of coloring matter, the cicatrix being generally whiter than the sound
skin of the people, most frequently of the dark races, among whom the
practice is found. This form of figuration is distinguished as scarification
and some examples of it are given below. The two varieties of
tattoo may, however, for the purpose of this paper, be considered
together and also in relation to painting the human body, which in its
early use differs from them only in duration.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Spencer (<i>a</i>) considers all forms of tattoo to be originally
tribal marks, and draws from that assumption additional evidence for
his favorite theory of the deification of a dead tribal chief. Miss A.
W. Buckland (<i>a</i>), in her essay on tattooing, follows in the same track,
although recognizing modern deviations from the rule. A valuable
article in the literature of the subject entitled “Tattooing among
civilized people,” by Dr. Robert Fletcher should be consulted. Also <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">A
tatuagem em Portugal</span>, by Rocha Peixoto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. C. N. Starcke (<i>a</i>) lays down the law still more distinctly, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The tattoo-marks make it possible to discover the remote connection between
clans, and this token has such a powerful influence on the mind that there is no
feud between tribes which are tattooed in the same way. * * * Tattooing may
also lead to the formation of a group within the tribe.</p></div>

<p>Prof. Frederick Starr (<i>a</i>) makes these remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As a sign of war prowess the gash of the Kaffir warrior may be described. After
an act of bravery the priest cuts a deep gash in the hero’s thigh. This heals blue
and is a prized honor. To realize the value of a tribal mark think for a moment of
the savage man’s relation to the world outside. He is a very Ishmaelite. So long
as he remains on his own tribal territory he is safe; when on the land of another
tribe his life is the legitimate prey of the first man he meets. To men in such social
relations the tribal mark is the only safety at home; without it he would be slain
unrecognized by his own tribesmen. There must have been a time when the old
Hebrews knew all about this matter of tribe marks. By this custom only can we
fully understand the story of Cain (Gen. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV</span>, 14, 15), who fears to be sent from his
own territory lest he be slain by the first stranger he meets, but is protected by the
tribal mark of those among whom he is to wander being put upon him. But in
scarring, as in so many other cases, the original idea is often lost and the mark becomes
merely ornamental. This is particularly true among women. Among men
it more frequently retains its tribal significance.</p></div>

<p>After careful study of the topic, less positive and conclusive authority
is found for this explanation of tattooing than was expected, considering
its general admission.</p>

<p>The great antiquity of tattooing is shown by reference to it in the
Old Testament, and in Herodotus, Xenophon, Tacitus, Ammianus, and
Herodian. The publications on the topic are so numerous that the
notes now to be presented are by no means exhaustive. They mainly
refer to the Indian tribes of North America with only such comparatively
recent reports from other lands as seem to afford elucidation.</p>


<h4>TATTOO IN NORTH AMERICA.</h4>

<p>G. Holm (<i>b</i>) says of the Greenland Innuit that geometric figures consisting
of streaks and points, are used in tattooing on the breasts, arms,
and legs of the females.</p>

<p>H. H. Bancroft (<i>b</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Eskimo females tattoo lines on their chins; the plebeian female of certain
bands has one vertical line in the center and one parallel to it on either side. The
higher classes mark two vertical lines from each corner of the mouth. * * *
Young Kadiak wives tattoo the breast and adorn the face with black lines. The
Kuskoquim women sew into their chin two parallel blue lines.</p></div>

<p>William H. Gilder (<i>a</i>) reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Esquimau wife has her face tattooed with lampblack and is regarded as a
matron in society. * * * The forehead is decorated with the letter V in double
lines, the angle very acute, passing down between the eyes almost to the bridge of
the nose, and sloping gracefully to the right and left before reaching the roots
of the hair. Each cheek is adorned with an egg-shaped pattern, commencing near
the wing of the nose and sloping upward toward the corner of the eye; these lines
are also double. The most ornamented part, however, is the chin, which receives
a gridiron pattern; the lines double from the edge of the lower lip, and reaching to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393">[393]</a></span>
the throat toward the corners of the mouth, sloping outward to the angle of the
lower jaw. This is all that is required by custom, but some of the belles do not
stop here. * * * None of the men are tattooed.</p></div>

<p>An early notice of tattooing in the territory now occupied by the
United States, mentioned in Hakluyt (<i>d</i>), is in the visit of the Florida
chief, Satouriona, in 1564, to Réné Laudonnière. His tattooed figure
was drawn by Le Moyne, Tabulæ <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII, IX</span>.</p>

<p>Capt. John Smith (<i>a</i>) is made to say of the Virginia Indians:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They adorne themselues most with copper beads and paintings. Their women,
some haue their legs, hands, breasts and face cunningly imbrodered with divers
workes, as beasts, serpents, artificially wrought into their flesh with blacke spots.</p></div>

<p>Frère Gabriel Sagard (<i>b</i>) says (about 1636) of the Hurons that they
tattooed by scratching with a bone of bird or fish, a black powder being
applied to the bleeding wounds. The operation was not completed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394">[394]</a></span>
once, but required several renewals. The object was to show bravery
by supporting great pain as well as to terrify enemies.</p>

<p>In the Jesuit Relation for 1641, p. 75, it is said of the Neuter Nation
that on their bodies from head to foot they marked a thousand diverse
figures with charcoal pricked into the flesh on which beforehand they
have traced lines for them.</p>

<p>Lemoyne D’Iberville, in 1649, Margry (<i>b</i>), remarked among the Bayogoulas
that some of the young women had their faces and breasts
pricked and marked with black.</p>

<p>In the Jesuit Relation for 1663, p. 28, there is an account that the head
chief of the Iroquois, called by the French Nero, had killed sixty enemies
with his own hand, the marks of which he bears printed on his thigh,
which, therefore, appears covered over with black characters.</p>

<p>Joutel, in Margry (<i>c</i>), speaks of tattooing among the Texas Indians
in 1687. Some women make a streak from the top of the forehead to
chin, some make a triangle at the corners of their eyes, others on the
breast and shoulders, others prick the lips. The marks are indelible.</p>

<p>Bacqueville de la Potherie (<i>b</i>) says of the Iroquois:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They paint several colors on the face, as black, white, yellow, blue, and vermillion.
Men paint snakes from the forehead to the nose, but they prick the greater part of
the body with a needle to draw blood. Bruised gunpowder makes the first coat to
receive the other colors, of which they make such figures as they desire and they are
never effaced.</p></div>

<p>M. Bossu (<i>a</i>) says of tatooing among the Osages in 1756:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a kind of knighthood to which they are only entitled by great actions; they
suffer with pleasure in order to pass for men of courage.</p>

<p>If one of them should get himself marked without having previously distinguished
himself in battle he would be degraded, and looked upon as a coward, unworthy of
an honor. * * *</p>

<p>I saw an Indian, who, though he had never signalized himself in defense of the
nation, got a mark made on his body in order to deceive those who only judged from
appearance. The council agreed that, to obviate such an abuse, which would confound
brave men with cowards, he who had wrongfully adorned himself with the
figure of a club on his skin, without ever having struck a blow at war, should have
the mark torn off; that is, the place should be flayed, and that the same should be
done to all who would offend in the same case.</p>

<p>The Indian women are allowed to make marks all over their body, without any
bad consequences; they endure it firmly, like the men, in order to please them, and
to appear handsomer to them.</p></div>

<p>James Adair (<i>a</i>) says of the Chikasas in 1720:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They readily know achievements in war by the blue marks over their breasts and
arms, they being as legible as our alphabetical characters are to us. Their ink is
made of the root of pitch pine, which sticks to the inside of a greased earthen pot;
then delineating the parts, they break through the skin with gairfish teeth, and rub
over them that dark composition, to register them among the brave, and the impression
is lasting. I have been told by the Chikasah that they formerly erased any
false marks their warriors proudly and privately gave themselves, in order to engage
them to give real proofs of their martial virtue, being surrounded by the French and
their red allies; and that they degraded them in a public manner, by stretching the
marked parts, and rubbing them with the juice of green corn, which in a great
degree took out the impression.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Alex. Mackenzie (<i>b</i>) tells that the Slave and Dog Rib Indians of
the Athabaskan stock practiced tatooing. The men had two double
lines, either black or blue, tattooed upon each cheek from the ear to the
nose.</p>

<p>In James’s Long (<i>c</i>) it is reported <span class="lock">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Omahas are often neatly tattooed in straight lines, and in angles on the breast,
neck, and arms. The daughters of chiefs and those of wealthy Indians generally are
denoted by a small round spot tattooed on the forehead. The process of tattooing
is performed by persons who make it a business of profit.</p></div>

<p>Rev. J. Owen Dorsey (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In order that the ghost may travel the ghost-road in safety it is necessary for each
Dakota, during his life, to be tattooed either in the middle of the forehead or on the
wrists. In that event his spirit will go directly to the “Many Lodges.”</p></div>

<p>The female Midē' of the Ojibwa frequently tattoo the temples, forehead,
or cheeks of sufferers from headache or toothache, which varieties
of pain are believed to be caused by some malevolent manido or spirit.
By this operation such demons are expelled, the ceremony being also
accompanied by songs and gesticulations of exorcism. Relief is sometimes
actually obtained through the counterirritant action of the tattooing,
which is effected by using a small bunch of needles, though
formerly several spicules of bone were tied together or used singly.</p>

<p>One old Ojibwa woman who was observed in 1887 had a round spot
over each temple, made there to cure headache. The spots were of a
bluish-black color, and about five-eighths of an inch in diameter. Another
had a similar spot upon the nasal eminence, and a line of small
dots running from the nostrils, horizontally outward over either cheek,
two-thirds of the distance to the ears.</p>

<p>The men of the Wichita wore tattoo lines from the lips downward,
and it is a significant fact that their tribal sign means “tattooed people,”
the same expression being used to designate them in the language
of several neighboring tribes. This would imply that tattooing was
not common in that region. The Kaiowa women, however, frequently
had small circles tattooed on their foreheads, and the Sixtown Choctaws
still are distinguished by perpendicular lines tatooed on the chin.</p>

<p>Mr. John Murdoch (<i>b</i>) reports of the Eskimo:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The custom of tattooing is almost universal among the women, but the marks are
confined almost exclusively to the chin, and form a very simple pattern. This consists
of one, three, five, or perhaps as many as seven vertical lines from the under
lip to the tip of the chin, slightly radiating when there are more than one. When
there is a single line, which is rather rare, it is generally broad, and the middle line
is sometimes broader than the others. The women, as a rule, are not tattooed until
they reach a marriageable age, though there were a few little girls in the two
villages who had a single line on the chin. I remember seeing but one married
woman in either village who was not tattooed, and she had come from a distant
settlement, from Point Hope, as well as we could understand.</p>

<p>Tattooing on a man is a mark of distinction. Those men who are, or have been,
captains of whaling umiaks that have taken whales have marks to indicate this tattooed
somewhere on their persons, sometimes forming a definite tally. For instance,
An̄oru had a broad band across each cheek from the corners of the mouth, made up<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396">[396]</a></span>
of many indistinct lines, which was said to indicate “many whales.” Amaiyuna
had the “flukes” of seven whales in a line across his chest, and Mû'n̄ialu had a
couple of small marks on one forearm. Niăksára, the wife of An̄oru, also had a little
mark tattooed in each corner of her mouth, which she said were “whale marks,”
indicating that she was the wife of a successful whaleman. Such marks, according
to Petitot (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monographie</span>, etc., p. 15), are a part of the usual pattern in the Mackenzie
district&mdash;“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux traits aux commissures de la bouche</span>.” One or two men at Nuwŭk
had each a narrow line across the face over the bridge of the nose, which were probably
also “whale marks,” though we never could get a definite answer concerning
them.</p>

<p>The tattooing is done with a needle and thread, smeared with soot or gunpowder,
giving a peculiar pitted appearance to the lines. It is rather a painful operation,
producing considerable inflammation and swelling, which lasts several days. The
practice of tattooing the women is almost universal among the Eskimo from Greenland
to Kadiak, including the Eskimo of Siberia, the only exception being the
natives of Smith sound, though the custom is falling into disuse among the Eskimo
who have much intercourse with the whites.</p>

<p>The simple pattern of straight, slightly diverging lines on the chin seems to prevail
from the Mackenzie district to Kadiak, and similar chin lines appear always to form
part of the more elaborate patterns, sometimes extending to the arms and other
parts of the body, in fashion among the eastern Eskimo and those of Siberia, St.
Lawrence island, and the Diomedes.</p></div>

<h5>TATTOO ON THE PACIFIC COAST.</h5>

<p>During the summer of 1884 Dr. Hoffman met, at Port Townsend,
Washington, a party of Haida Indians from Queen Charlottes island,
who were encamped there for a short time. Most of them were tattooed
after the manner of the Haidas, the breast, back, forearm, and legs
bearing partial or complete designs of animate forms relating to totems
or myths. Some of the persons had been tattooed only in part, the figures
upon the forearms, for instance, being incomplete, because the
operation at a previous “potlatch” or festival had to be suspended on
account of the great length of time required, or on account of an extra
inflammatory condition of the affected parts.</p>

<p>Among this party of Haidas was Makdē'gos, the tattooer of the tribe,
whose work is truly remarkable. The designs made by him are symmetrical,
while the lines are uniform in width and regular and graceful
in every respect. In persons tattooed upon the breast or back the part
operated upon is first divided into halves by an imaginary vertical line
upon the breast through the middle of the sternum and upon the back
along the middle of the vertebral column. Such designs are drawn
double, facing outward from this imaginary line. One side is first
drawn and completed, while the other is merely a reverse transfer,
made immediately afterwards or at such future time as the operation
of tattooing may be renewed.</p>

<p>The colors are black and red, the former consisting of finely powdered
charcoal, gunpowder, or India ink, while the latter is Chinese vermilion.
The operation was formerly performed with sharp thorns, spines
of certain fishes, or spicules of bone; but recently a small bunch of
needles is used, which serves the purpose to better effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>As is well known, the black pigments, when picked into the human
skin, become rather bluish, which tint, when beneath the yellowish tinge
of the Indian’s cuticle, appears of an olive or sometimes a greenish-blue
shade. The colors, immediately after being tattooed upon the skin,
retain more or less of the blue-black shade; but by absorption of the
pigment and the persistence of the coloring matter of the pigmentary
membrane the greenish tint soon appears, becoming gradually less conspicuous
as time progresses, so that in some of the oldest tattooed
Indians the designs are greatly weakened in coloration.</p>

<p>Upon the bodies of some persons examined the results of ulceration
are conspicuous. This destruction of tissue is the result of inflammation
caused by the tattooing and the introduction under the skin of so
great a quantity of irritating foreign matter that, instead of designs in
color, there are distinct, sharply defined figures in white or nearly white
cicatrices, the pigmentary membrane having been totally destroyed by
the ulceration.</p>

<p>The figures represented upon the several Indians met with, as above-mentioned,
were not all of totemic signification, one arm, for instance,
bearing the figure of the totem of which the person is a member, while
the other arm presents the outline of a mythic being, as shown in Fig.
517, copied from the arms of a woman. The left device is taken
from the left forearm, and represents kul, the skulpin, a totemic animal,
whereas the right hand device, taken from the right arm of the same

<p>In Fig. 518 two forms of the thunderbird are presented, copied from
the right and left forearms and hands, respectively, of a Haida woman.
The right hand device is complete, but that on the left, copied from the
opposite forearm and hand, is incomplete, and it was expected that the
design would be entirely finished at the “potlatch” which was to be
held in the autumn of 1884. In the completed design the transverse curve
in the body of the tail was red, as also the three diagonal lines upon the
body of the bird running outward from the central vertical toward the
radial side of the hand. The brace-shaped lines within the head ornament
had also been tattooed in red.</p>

<p>In some instances the totem and mythic character are shown upon
the same member, as is represented in Fig. 519. This tattooing was copied
from the left arm of a woman, the complete figure upon the forearm
and hand being that of a thunder bird, while the four heads upon the
fingers represent that of the tshimō's, a mythic animal. The thunder-bird
had been tattooed upon the arms a number of years before the
heads were added, probably because the protracted and painful operation
of tattooing so large a figure deterred the sufferer from further
sitting. Sometimes, however, such, postponement or noncompletion of
an operation is the result of inability on the part of the subject to defray
the expense.</p>

<p>Another instance of the interrupted condition of tattooed designs is
presented in Fig. 520. The figure upon the forearm and hand is that
of the bear totem, and was made first. At a subsequent festival the
bear heads were tattooed upon the fingers, and, last of all, the body
was tattoed upon the middle finger, leaving three yet to be completed.</p>

<p>Among all the tribes or bands belonging to the Haida family, the practice of tattooing
the person in some manner is common; but the most marked are the Haidas
proper, or those living on Queen Charlotte islands, and the Kaiganis, of Prince of
Wales archipelago, Alaska.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>I am of the opinion, judging from my own observation of over twenty years
among the coast tribes, that but few females can be found among the Indians, not
only on Vancouvers island, but all along the coast to the Columbia river, and perhaps
even to California, that are <i>not</i> marked with some device tattooed on their
hands, arms, or ankles, either dots or straight lines; but of all of the tribes mentioned,
the Haidas stand preeminent for tattooing, and seem to be excelled only by
the natives of the Fiji islands or the King’s Mills group in the south seas. The
tattoo marks of the Haidas are heraldic designs or the family totem, or crests of the
wearers, and are similar to the carvings depicted on the pillars and monuments
around the homes of the chiefs, which casual observers have thought were idols.</p>

<p>These designs are invariably placed on the men between the shoulders just below
the back of the neck, on the breast, on the front part of both thighs, and on the
legs below the knee. On the women they are marked on the breast, on both shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404">[404]</a></span>
on both forearms, from the elbow down over the back of the hands to the
knuckles, and on both legs below the knee to the ankle.</p>

<p>Almost all of the Indian women of the northwest coast have tattoo marks on their
hands and arms, and some on the face; but as a general thing these marks are mere
dots or straight lines having no particular significance. With the Haidas, however,
every mark has its meaning; those on the hands and arms of the women indicate
the family name, whether they belong to the bear, beaver, wolf, or eagle totems, or
any of the family of fishes. As one of them quaintly remarked to me, “If you were
tattooed with the design of a swan, the Indians would know your family name.”</p>

<p>In order to illustrate this tattooing as correctly as possible I inclose herewith
sketches of the tattoo marks on two women and their husbands, taken by me at Port
Townsend.</p></div>

<p>As the Haidas, both men and women, are very light-colored, some of

Europeans, the tattoo marks show very distinct.</p>

<p>The same author continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This tattooing is not all done at one time, nor is it everyone who can tattoo. Certain
ones, almost always men, have a natural gift which enables them to excel in
this kind of work. One of the young chiefs, named Geneskelos, was the best designer
I knew, and ranked among his tribe as a tattooer.</p>

<p>He told me the plan he adopted was first to draw the design carefully on the person
with some dark pigment, then prick it in with needles, and then rub over the
wound with some more coloring matter till it acquired the proper hue. He had a
variety of instruments composed of needles tied neatly to sticks. His favorite one
was a flat strip of ivory or bone, to which he had firmly tied five or six needles, with
their points projecting beyond the end just far enough to raise the skin without
inflicting a dangerous wound, but these needle points stuck out quite sufficiently to
make the operation very painful, and although he applied some substance to deaden
the sensation of the skin, yet the effect was on some to make them quite sick for a few
days; consequently, the whole process of tattooing was not done at one time. As
this tattooing is a mark of honor, it is generally done at or just prior to a Tomanawos
performance and at the time of raising the heraldic columns in front of the chief’s
houses. The tattooing is done in open lodge and is witnessed by the company assembled.
Sometimes it takes several years before all the tattooing is done, but when
completed and the person well ornamented, then they are happy and can take their
seats among the elders.</p></div>

<p>Other notices about the tattooing of the Indians of the Pacific slope
of North America are subjoined.</p>

<p>Stephen Powers (<i>c</i>) says the Karok (California) squaws tattoo in blue
three narrow fern leaves perpendicularly on the chin, one falling from
each corner of the mouth and one in the middle.</p>

<p>The same author reports, page 76:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nearly every (Hupâ, California) man has ten lines tattooed across the inside of the
left arm about halfway between the wrist and the elbow; and in measuring shell
money he takes the string in his right hand, draws one end over his left thumb nail,
and if the other end reaches to the uppermost of the tattoo lines the five shells are
worth $25 in gold, or $5 a shell. Of course, it is only one in ten thousand that is long
enough to reach this high value.</p></div>

<p>Also on page 96:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Pátawāt (California) squaws tattoo in blue three narrow pinnate leaves perpendicularly
on their chins, and also lines of small dots on the backs of their hands.</p></div>

<p>On page 148, of the Kástel Pomo:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The women of this and other tribes of the Coast range frequently tattoo a rude
representation of a tree or other object covering nearly the whole abdomen and
breast.</p></div>

<p>Of the Wintūns he says, page 233: “The squaws all tattoo three narrow
lines, one falling from each corner of the mouth and one between.”</p>

<p>The same author says, on page 109:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Mattoal, of California, differ from other tribes in that the men tattoo. Their
distinctive mark is a round blue spot in the center of the forehead. The women
tattoo pretty much all over their faces.</p>

<p>In respect to this matter of tattooing there is a theory entertained by some old
pioneers which may be worth the mention. They hold that the reason why the
women alone tattoo in all other tribes is that in case they are taken captives their
own people may be able to recognize them when there comes an opportunity of ransom.
There are two facts which give some color of probability to this reasoning.
One is that the California Indians are rent into such infinitesimal divisions, any
one of which may be arrayed in deadly feud against another at any moment, that the
slight differences in their dialects would not suffice to distinguish the captive squaws.
The second is that the squaws almost never attempt any ornamental tattooing, but
adhere closely to the plain regulation mark of the tribe.</p></div>

<p>Blue marks tattooed upon a Mohave woman’s chin denote that she
is married. See Whipple (<i>f</i>).</p>

<p>Mr. Gatschet reports that very few Klamath men now tattoo their
faces, but such as are still observed have but a single line of black running
from the middle of the lower lip to the chin. Half-breed girls
appear to have but one perpendicular line tattooed down over the chin
while the full-blood women have four perpendicular lines on the chin.</p>

<p>In Bancroft’s Native Races (<i>c</i>), it is stated that the Modoc women
tattoo three blue lines, extending perpendicularly from the center and
corners of the lower lip to the chin.</p>

<p>The same author on pages 117 and 127 of the same volume says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Chippewas have tattooed cheeks and foreheads. Both sexes have blue or
black bars or from one to four straight lines to distinguish the tribe to which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407">[407]</a></span>
belong. They tattoo by entering an awl or needle under the skin and drawing it
out, immediately rubbing powdered charcoal into the wounds. * * * On the
Yukon river among the Kutchins, the men draw a black stripe down the forehead
and the nose, frequently crossing the forehead and cheeks with red lines and streaking
the chin alternately with red and black, and the women tattoo the chin with a
black pigment.</p></div>

<p>Stephen Powers, in Overland Monthly, <span class="smcap lowercase">XII</span>, 537, 1874, says of the
Normocs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I saw a squaw who had executed on her cheeks the only representation of a living
object which I ever saw done in tattooing. It was a couple of bird’s wings, one on
each cheek, done in blue, bottom-edge up, the butt of the wing at the corner of the
mouth, and the tip near the ear. It was quite well wrought, both in correctness of
form and in delicateness of execution, not only separate feathers but even the filaments
of the vane, being finely pricked in.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Franz Boas (<i>c</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tattooings are found on arms, breast, back, legs, and feet among the Haida; on
arms and feet among the Tshimshian, Kwakiutl and Bilqula; on breast and arms
among the Nootka; on the jaw among the Coast Salish women.</p>

<p>Among the Nootka scars may frequently be seen running at regular intervals from
the shoulder down the breast to the belly, and in the same way down the legs and
arms. * * *</p>

<p>Members of tribes practicing the Hamats'a ceremonies show remarkable scars produced
by biting. At certain festivals it is the duty of the Hamats'a to bite a piece
of flesh out of the arms, leg, or breast of a man.</p></div>


<h4>TATTOO IN SOUTH AMERICA.</h4>

<p>Dr. im Thurn (<i>c</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tattooing or any other permanent interference with the surface of the skin by
way of ornament is practiced only to a very limited extent by the Indians; is used,
in fact, only to produce the small distinctive tribal mark which many of them
bear at the corners of their mouths or on their arms. It is true that an adult Indian
is hardly to be found on whose thighs and arms, or on other parts of whose body
are not a greater or less number of indelibly incised straight lines; but these are scars
originally made for surgical, not ornamental purposes.</p></div>

<p>Herndon and Gibbon (<i>a</i>), p. 319, report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Following the example of the other nations of Brazil (who tattoo themselves with
thorns, or pierce their nose, the lips, and the ears,) and obeying an ancient law
which commands these different tortures, this baptism of blood, * * * the
Mahués have preserved * * * the great festival of the Tocandeira.</p></div>

<p>Paul Marcoy (<i>b</i>) says of the Passés, Yuris, Barrés, and Chumanas,
of Brazil, that they mark their faces (in tattoo) with the totem, or emblem
of the nation to which they belong. It is possible at a few steps
distant to distinguish one nation from another.</p>


<h4>EXTRA-LIMITAL TATTOO.</h4>

<p>Ancient monarchs adopted special marks to distinguish slaves; likewise
for vengeance as an indelible and humiliating brand, a certain
tattoo denounced him who had fallen into disgrace with a sovereign.
Two monks having censured the iconoclastic frenzy of the emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408">[408]</a></span>
Theophilus, he ordered to be imprinted on their foreheads eleven iambic
verses; Philip of Macedon, from whom a soldier had solicited the
possession of a man saved by him from shipwreck, ordered that on
his forehead should be drawn signs indicative of his base greed; Caligula,
without any object, commanded the tattooing of the Roman
nobles.</p>

<p>In the period of the decline of Rome, tattooing was extensively practiced.
Regulative laws prescribed the adopted symbols which were a
proof of enlistment in the ranks and on which the military oath was
taken. The purpose of this ordinance, which continued in force for a
long time, was similar to that which authorized the marking of the
slaves, since, the spirit of the people having become degenerated, the
army was composed of mercenaries who, if they should run away, must
be recognized, pursued, and captured. Until recently the practice,
though more as a mark of manhood, was followed by the soldiers of
the Piedmontese army.</p>

<p>Élisée Reclus (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tattooing was in Polynesia widespread, and so highly developed that the artistic
designs covering the body served also to clothe it. In certain islands the operation
lasted so long that it had to be begun before the children were six years old, and
the pattern was largely left to the skill and cunning of the professional tattooers.
Still traditional motives recurred in the ornamental devices of the several tribes,
who could usually be recognized by their special tracings, curved or parallel lines,
diamond forms and the like. The artists were grouped in schools like the old masters
in Europe, and they worked not by incision as in most Melanesian islands, but by
punctures with a small comb-like instrument slightly tapped with a mallet. The
pigment used in the painful and even dangerous operation was usually the fine charcoal
yielded by the nut of Aleurites triloba, an oleaginous plant used for illuminating
purposes throughout eastern Polynesia.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is from Rev. Richard Taylor (<i>c</i>) about the New Zealanders,
Te Ika a Maui:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Before they went to fight, the youth were accustomed to mark their countenances
with charcoal in different lines, and their traditions state that this was the beginning
of the tattoo, for their wars became so continuous, that to save the trouble of thus
constantly painting the face, they made the lines permanent by the moko; it is, however,
a question whether it did not arise from a different cause; formerly the grand
mass of men who went to fight were the black slaves, and when they fought side by
side with their lighter colored masters, the latter on those occasions used charcoal to
make it appear they were all one.</p>

<p>Whilst the males had every part of the face tattooed, and the thighs as well, the
females had chiefly the chin and the lips, although occasionally they also had their
thighs and breasts, with a few smaller marks on different parts of the body as well.
There were regular rules for tattooing, and the artist always went systematically to
work, beginning at one spot and gradually proceeding to another, each particular
part having its distinguishing name.</p></div>

been abandoned. The work consists of sharp, shallow lines, as if made<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410">[410]</a></span>

has been rubbed, filling up some of the markings, while in others

</div>

<p>Fig. 535 is a copy of a photograph obtained in New Zealand by Prof.
Russell. It shows tattooing upon the chin.</p>

<p>Prof. Russell, in his sketch of New Zealand, published in the Am.
Naturalist, <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span>, 72, Feb., 1879, remarks, that the desire of the Maori
for ornament is so great that they covered their features with tattooing,
transferring indelibly to their faces complicated patterns of curved and
spiral lines, similar to the designs with which they decorated their
canoes and their houses.</p>

<p>E. J. Wakefield (<i>a</i>) reports of a man observed in New Zealand that
he was a tangata tabu or sacred personage, and consequently was not
adorned with tatu. He adds, p. 155, that the deeds of the natives are
signed with elaborate drawings of the moko or tatu on the chiefs’ faces.</p>

<p>Dr. George Turner (<i>b</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Herodotus found among the Thracians that the man who was not tattooed was not
respected. It was the same in Samoa. Until a young man was tattooed he was considered
in his minority. He could not think of marriage, and he was constantly
exposed to taunts and ridicule, as being poor and of low birth, and as having no<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411">[411]</a></span>
right to speak in the society of men. But as soon as he was tattooed he passed into
his majority, and considered himself entitled to the respect and privileges of mature
years. When a youth, therefore, reached the age of 16, he and his friends were
all anxiety that he should be tattooed. He was then on the outlook for the tattooing
of some young chief with whom he might unite. On these occasions six or a
dozen young men would be tattooed at one time, and for these there might be four
or five tattooers employed. Tattooing is still kept up to some extent and is a
regular profession, just as house-building, and well paid. The custom is traced to
mythologic times and has its presiding deities.</p></div>

<p>Tattoo marks of Papuan men in New Guinea can be worn on the chest only when
the man has killed an enemy. Fig. 26, p. 101, shows the marks upon the chest of
Waara, who had killed five men.</p>

<p>Tattoo marks upon parts other than the chest of the bodies of men and women do
not seem to have significance. They are made according to the fancy of the designer.
Frequently the professional tattooers have styles of their own, which, being popular
and generally applied, become customary to a tribe.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the Papuans of New Guinea tattooing the chest of females denotes that
they are married, though all other parts of the body, including the face and legs,
may be tattooed long before; indeed the tattooing of girls may begin at 5 years of
age. Fig. 39, p. 112, gives an illustration of a married woman. * * * The different
forms of tattoo depend upon the style of the several artists. Family marks
are not recognizable, but exist.</p></div>

<p>De Clercq (<i>a</i>) gives further particulars about tattooing among the
Papuans of New Guinea. Among the Sègèt it is only on women.
They call it “fadjan,” and the figures consist of two rows of little circles,
on each side of the abdomen toward the region of the arm-pit, with
a few cross strokes on the outer edge; it is done by pricking with a
needle and afterwards the spots are fumigated with the smoke of burning
resin. It is said to be intended as an ornament instead of dress,
and that young girls do it because young men like to see it.</p>

<p>At Roembati tattooing is called “gomanroeri” and at Sĕkar “béti.”
They do it there with bones of fish, with which they prick many holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412">[412]</a></span>
in the skin until the blood flows, and then smear on it in spots the soot
from pans and pots, which, after the staunching of the blood, leaves an
ineffaceable bluish spot or streak. Besides the breast and upper arm
they also tattoo in the same way the calf of the leg, and in some cases
the forehead, as a mere ornamentation, both of men and women&mdash;children
only in very exceptional cases.</p>

<p>The Bonggose and Sirito are much tattooed over the breast and
shoulder. At Saoekorèm, a Doré settlement, a few women were seen
tattooed on the breast and in the face. At Doré it is called “pa,” and
is done with thorns, and charcoal is rubbed
over the bloody spots; only here and at Mansinam is
it a sign of mourning; everywhere else
it merely serves as ornamentation.</p>

<p>At Ansoes it does not occur much, and is
principally in the face; it is there called “toi.”
It is found somewhat more commonly on Noord-Japèn,
and then on shoulder and upper arm.
In Tarfia, Tana-mérah, and Humboldt bay but
few persons were tattooed, mostly on the forehead.</p>

<p>The tattooing is always the work of women,
generally members of the family, both on men
and on women. First the figure is drawn with
charcoal, and if it suits the taste then begins
the pricking with the thorn of a citrus or a fine
bone of some animal. It is very painful and
only a small spot can be pricked at one time,
so long as the tattooee can stand it. If the
pain is too violent, the wounds are gently pressed
with a certain leaf that has been warmed, in
order to soothe the pain, and the work is continued
only after three or four days. No special
names are given to the figures; those are chosen
which suit the taste. Children are never tattooed

a matter of individual choice.</p>

<p>Mr. Forbes, in Journ. Anthrop. Inst. G. B.
and I., August, 1883, p. 10, says that in Timor Laut, an island of the
Malay <span class="lock">archipelago&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Both sexes tattoo a few simple devices, circles, stars, and pointed crosses, on the
breast, on the brow, on the cheek, and on the wrists, and scar themselves on the
arms and shoulders with red-hot stones, in imitation of immense smallpox marks,
in order to ward off that disease. * * * I have, however, seen no one variola-marked,
nor can I learn of any epidemic of this disease among them.</p></div>

<p>Prof. Brauns, of Halle, reports, Science, <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span>, No. 50, p. 69, that among

<p>Carl Bock (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All the married women here are tattooed on the hands and feet and sometimes on
the thighs. The decoration is one of the privileges of matrimony and is not permitted
to unmarried girls.</p></div>

<p>In Myths and Songs from the South Pacific, London, 1876, p. 94, it is
said that in Mangaia, of the Hervey group, the tattoo is in imitation of
the stripes on the two kinds of fish, avini and paoro, the color of which
is blue. The legend of this is kept in the song of Iná.</p>

<p>Elisée Reclus (<i>b</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Most of the Dayaks tattoo the arms, hands, feet, and thighs; occasionally also
breast and temples. The designs, generally of a beautiful blue color on the coppery
ground of the body, display great taste, and are nearly always disposed in odd numbers,
which, as among so many other peoples, are supposed to be lucky.</p></div>

<p>In L’Anthropologie (<i>a</i>), 1890, T. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, No. 6, p. 693, it is thus reported:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tradition tells that the Giao chi, the alleged ancestors of the Annamites, were
fishermen and in danger from marine monsters. To prevent disasters from the genii
of the waters the king directed the people to tattoo their bodies with the forms of
the marine monsters, and afterwards the dragons, crocodiles, etc., ceased their persecution.
The custom became universal, and even the kings tattooed a dragon on
their thighs as a sign of power and nobility. The same idea was in the painting of
eyes, etc., on the prows of Annamite boats, which strongly resembled the sea monsters.</p></div>

<p>Mr. O’Reilly, the professional tattooer of New York, in a letter, says
that he is familiar with the tattoo system of Burmah, and that, besides
the ruling principle of ordeal, the Burmese use special tattoo marks to
charm and to bring love. They also believe that tattooing the whole
person renders the skin impenetrable to weapons.</p>

<p>In <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</span> (<i>a</i>) it is recounted of the Badagas in
the Nilgiri mountains, India:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All the women are tattooed on the forehead. The following [Fig. 538] <i>a</i> is the
most usual form:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>Nordenskiöld (<i>a</i>) gives the following account of tattooing among
the Chukchis of Siberia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is principally the women that tattoo. The operation is performed by means of
pins and soot; perhaps also graphite is employed, which the Chukchis gather. The
tattooing of the women seems to be the same along the whole Chukchi coast from Cape
Shelagskoy to Bering strait. The usual mode of tattooing is found represented in
Nordenskiöld’s “Voyage of the Vega around Asia and Europe,” second part, p. 104.
Still the tattooing on the cheek is not rarely more compound than is there shown.
The picture given below [Fig. 539] represents a design of tattooing on the cheek.</p>

<p>Girls under nine or ten years are never tattooed. On reaching that age they
gradually receive the two streaks running from the point of the nose to the root of
the hair; next follow the vertical chin streaks and lastly the tattooing on the cheeks,
of which the anterior arches are first formed and the posterior part of the design
last. The last named in fact is the part of the design which is oftenest wanting.</p>

<p>The accompanying picture (the left hand of the same Fig.) represents the tattooing
of the arms of a woman from the town of T’ápka. The design of the tattooing
extends from the shoulder joint, where the upper triple ring is situated, to the hand
joint at the bottom. As appears from the drawing, the tattooing on the right and
left arm is different.</p>

<p>The men at the winter station of the Vega tattooed themselves only with two
short horizontal streaks across the root of the nose. Some of the men at Rerkaypiya
(C. North), on the other hand, had a cross tattooed on each cheek bone; others had
merely painted similar ones with red mold. Some Chukchis at the latter place had
also the upper lip tattooed.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Bazin, in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Étude sur le Tatouage dans la Régence de Tunis</span>,” in
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Anthropologie</span> (<i>b</i>), tells that the practice of tattooing is very widespread
and elaborate in Tunisia, but chiefly among the natives of
Arab race, who are nomads, workmen in the towns, and laborers, and
also among the fellahs. The Berbers, on the contrary, who have remained
mountaineers, the merchants of the coast towns, and the rich
proprietors are little or not at all tattooed. In regard to the last class
this proves that tattooing has become nothing but an ornament, since
the members of this class are clothed in such a way that the legs and
arms are completely covered, so that it would be useless to draw figures
which would be invisible or almost entirely hidden. He adds<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415">[415]</a></span>
that the notables “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">du Tinge</span>” do not disfigure themselves by incisions.
The distinctive sign of the lower classes is the presence of three incisions
on the temples, three on the cheeks, and three also on the lower
part of the face.</p>

<p>Notes on East-Equatorial Africa, in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bull. Soc. d’Anthro. de Bruxelles</span>
(<i>a</i>) contains the following memoranda: Tattooing is done by
traveling artists. Perhaps at first it showed tribal characteristics,
but now it is difficult to distinguish more than fancy. The exception
is that Wawenba alone tattoo the face. The local fetiches bear marks
of tattoo.</p>

<p>Gordon Cumming (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of the “generals” of Mosielely, King of the Bakatlas group of the Bechuana
tribe, had killed about twenty men in battle with his own hand, and bore a mark of
honor for every man. This mark was a line tattooed on his ribs.</p></div>

<p>David Greig Rutherford (<i>a</i>) makes remarks on the people of Batanga,
West Tropical Africa, from which the following is extracted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tattooing evidently originated in certain marks being applied to the face and
other parts of the body in order to distinguish the members of one tribe from those
of another. The same marks would be used for both sexes, but as the tendency to
ornamentation became developed, they would be apt to observe some artistic method
in making them. Among the Dualles the custom at one time appears to have obtained
with both sexes, with a preponderance, however, in the practice of it on the
side of the women. The men did not always see the force of giving themselves
needless pain, but the women, with a shrewd idea that it added to their charms,
persisted in having it done. The men (and it is significant that in places where the
men have ceased to tattoo themselves they continue to do it for the women) tattooed
their children at an early age, but as the girls approached a marriageable age they
added, on their own account, various ornamentations to those already existing. As
an example that tattooing in its later stages is regarded as an increase of beauty, I
may mention an instance given me by the wife of a missionary here. A woman belonging
to some neighboring tribe having come to stay at the mission, was presented
with a dress of some showy material as an inducement to her to discard the loin
cloth she had been in the habit of wearing and as an introduction to the habits of
civilized life. She objected to wear the dress, however, upon the ground that if
she did so she would thereby hide her beauty. It appears certain that the unmarried
woman who is most finely tattooed wins most admiration from the men.</p></div>

<p>Oscar Peschel (<i>a</i>) describes tattooing as another substitute for raiment
and remarks: “That it actually takes away from the impression
of nudity is declared by all who have seen fully tattooed Albanese.”
As bearing in the same direction Mr. Darwin, in “Voyage of the
Beagle,” may be quoted, who, when at New Zealand, speaking of the
clean, tidy, and healthy appearance of the young women who acted as
servants within the houses, remarks: “The wives of the missionaries
tried to persuade them not to be tattooed, but a famous operator having
arrived from the south they said: ‘We really must have a few
lines on our lips, else when we grow old our lips will shrivel, and we
shall be so very ugly.’”</p>

<p>In September, 1891, a Zulu, claiming to be a son of the late Cetewayo,
gave to a reporter of the Memphis Avalanche the following account:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416">[416]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>When some one expressed a doubt of his coming from Zululand he promptly rolled
up his sleeve and showed on his right arm the brand of the tribe. The brand is just
below the elbow-joint, and it is of a bright red color, showing conclusively that it
had been burned into the flesh. The design is very much on the principle of a double
heart with a cross running through the center. The same design has been branded
over his left eye in a somewhat smaller shape. When questioned about these brands
he said:</p>

<p>“In our country all the men have to have the brand of their tribe burned into
their skin so that they can never desert us, and no matter where they are found, you
can always tell a Zulu by the brand. Always look for it just over the left eye and
on the inside of the right arm. Does it hurt? Oh, no: you see they just take the
skin together in their fingers and when the brand is red hot touch it once to the
skin and it is all done, and the brand can never wear away.”</p></div>


<h4>SCARIFICATION.</h4>

<p>The following notes regarding scarification are presented:</p>

<p>Edward M. Curr (<i>b</i>), p. 94, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The principal and most general ornament throughout Australia consists of a number
of scars raised on the skin. They are made by deep incisions with a flint or
shell, which are kept powdered with charcoal or ashes. The wounds thus made
remain open for about three months, and, when covered with skin, scars sometimes
almost as thick and long as one’s middle finger remain raised above the natural surface
of the skin. The incisions are made in rows on various parts of the body, principally
on the chest, back, and on the upper muscle of the arm, and less frequently
on the thighs and stomach. The breasts of the female are often surrounded with
smaller scars. In some tribes dots cut in the skin take the place of scars. The operation
is a very painful one, and is often carried out amidst yells of torture. Both
sexes are marked in this manner, but the male more extensively than the female.</p></div>

<p>In the same volume, p. 338, is the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When, as often happens, a young man and girl of the Whajook tribe in Australia
elope and remain away from the tribe for a time, it is not unusual for them to scar
each other in the interim as a memorial of their illicit loves; a singular proceeding
when one remembers the agony caused by the operation and the length of time required
to get over it. This proceeding is a great aggravation of the original offense
in the eyes of husbands.</p></div>

<p>In Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>, p. 414, the same author says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Men of the Cape river tribe scar their backs and shoulders in this way. Scars are
made generally on the left thigh both of the men and women, continues Mr. Chatfield,
but occasionally on the right, for the purpose of denoting the particular class
to which they belong; but as such a practice would conflict with the custom prevalent
throughout the continent as far as known, which is to make these marks for
ornament alone, the statement cannot be received without further evidence.</p></div>

<p>Thomas Worsnop, in the Prehistoric Arts of the Aborigines of Australia,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This practice of tattooing by scarification was common all over the continent,
varying in character amongst the respective tribes, each having its own distinctive
marks, although all patterned upon one monotonous idea.</p></div>

<p>This is far from evidence of distinct tribal marks, the slight varieties
of which may be only local or tribal fashions.</p>

<p>Alfred C. Haddon (<i>a</i>), p. 366, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tattooing is unknown, but the body used to be ornamented with raised cicatrices.
* * * The Torres strait islanders are distinguished by a large, complicated, oval<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417">[417]</a></span>
scar, only slightly raised and of neat construction. This, which I have been told
has some connection with a turtle, occupies the right shoulder and is occasionally
repeated on the left. I suspect that a young man was not allowed to bear a cicatrice
until he had killed his first turtle or dugong.</p></div>

<p>The same author, op. cit., says of the Mabuiag of Torres straits:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The people were formerly divided up into a number of clans. * * * A man belonging
to one clan could not wear the badge of the totem of another clan. * * *
All the totems appear to have been animals&mdash;as the crocodile, snake, turtle, dugong,
dog, cassowary, shark, sting-ray, kingfish, etc.</p></div>

<p>The same writer, in Notes on Mr. Beardsmore’s paper, in Jour. Anthrop.
Inst. of Gr. Br. and I. (<i>a</i>), says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A large number of the women of Mowat, New Guinea, have a Λ-shaped scar above
the breasts. * * * Maino of Tud told me that it was cut when the brother
leaves the father’s house and goes to live with the men; and another informant’s story
was that it was made when a brother harpooned his first dugong or turtle. Maino
(who, by the by, married a Mowat woman) said that a mark on the cheek recorded
the brother’s prowess.</p></div>

<p>D’Albertis (<i>c</i>) tells that the people of New Guinea produced scars
“by making an incision in the skin and then for a lengthened period
irritating it with lime and soot. * * * They use some scars as a
sign that they have traveled, and tattoo an additional figure above the
right breast on the accomplishment of every additional journey. * * *
In Yuli island women have nearly the whole body covered with marks.
Children are seldom tattooed; slaves never. Men are hardly ever tattooed,
though they have frequently marks on the chest and shoulders;
rarely on the face. Tribes and families are recognized by tattoo marks.”</p>

<p>Mr. Griffith, in his paper on Sierra Leone, in Jour. Anthrop. Inst. of
Gr. Br. and I. (<i>b</i>), says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The girls are cut on their backs and loins in such a manner as to leave raised scars,
which project above the surface of the skin about one-eighth of an inch. They then
receive Boondoo names, and after recovery from the painful operation are released
from Boondoo with great ceremony and gesticulation by some who personate Boondoo
devils. They are then publicly pronounced marriageable.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Holub (<i>b</i>), speaking of three cuts on the breast of a Koranna of
Central South Africa, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They have among themselves a kind of freemasonry. Some of them have on their
chest three cuts. When they were asked what was the reason of it they generally
refused to answer, but after gaining their confidence they confessed that they belonged
to something like a secret society, and they said, “I can go through all the
valleys inhabited by Korannas and Griquas, and wherever I go when I open my coat
and show these three cuts I am sure to be well received.”</p></div>

<p>Mr. H. H. Johnston (<i>a</i>) tells us that scarification is practiced right
along the course of the Congo up to the Stanley falls. The marks thus
made are tribal. Thus the Bateke are always distinguished by five or
six striated lines across the cheek bones, while the Bayansi scar their
foreheads with a horizontal or vertical band.</p>

<p>E. Brussaux, in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Anthropologie</span> (<i>c</i>), reports that scarifications in
Congo, which are chiefly on the back, are made for therapeutic reasons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>Julian Thomas (<i>a</i>) gives the following description of a New Hebrides
woman:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She had a pattern traced over her throat and breast like a scarf. It was done
with a shark’s tooth when a child. The women’s skins are blistered up into flowers
and ferns. The skin is cut and earth and ashes placed inside the gashes, and the
flesh grows into these forms. Of course they do not cover up these beauties by
clothing.</p></div>

<p>According to Mr. Man, Journ. Anthrop. Inst. of Gr. Br. and I. (<i>c</i>),
the Andamanese, who also tattoo by means of gashing, do so first by
way of ornament, and, secondly, to prove the courage of the individual
operated upon and his or her power of enduring pain.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY OF STUDIES ON TATTOOING.</h4>

<p>Many notes on the topic are omitted, especially those relating mainly
to the methods of and the instruments used in the operation. But from
those presented above it appears that tattooing still is or very recently
was used in various parts of the world for many purposes besides the
specific object of designating a tribe, clan, or family, and also apart
from the general intent of personal ornament. The most notable of
those purposes are as follows: 1, to distinguish between free and slave
without reference to the tribe of the latter; 2, to distinguish between
a high and low status in the same tribe; 3, as a certificate of bravery
exhibited by supporting the ordeal of pain; 4, as marks of personal
prowess, particularly, 5, as a record of achievements in war; 6, to show
religious symbols; 7, as a therapeutic remedy for disease, and 8, as a
prophylactic against disease; 9, as a brand of disgrace; 10, as a token
of a woman’s marriage, or, sometimes, 11, of her marriageable condition;
12, identification of the person, not as tribesman or clansman,
but as an individual; 13, to charm the other sex magically; 14, to
inspire fear in the enemy; 15, to magically render the skin impenetrable
by weapons; 16, to bring good fortune; and 17, as the device of a
secret society.</p>

<p>The use of tattoo marks as certificates and records of prowess in war
is considered to be of special importance in any discussion of their
origin. A warrior returns from the field stained with blood from an
honorable wound, the scars of which he afterwards proudly displays.
It would be strictly in the line of ideography to make artificial scars or
to paint the semblance of wounds on the person as designations of
honor, and from such origin quite as well as from a totemic representation
all other forms and uses may have been evolved. For instance,
the vigor of manhood being thus signified, the similar use would show
the maturity of women. Yet some of the practices of tattoo may have
originated independently of either totem or glory mark. The mere idea
of decoration as shown in what civilized people call deformations of
nose, lip, ear, teeth, and in fact all parts of the body, is sufficient to account
for the inception of any form of tattoo. Primitive man never<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419">[419]</a></span>
seemed to be content to leave the surface of his body in its natural condition,
and from recognition of that discontent studies of clothing and
of ornament should take their point of departure.</p>

<p>In this paper many examples are presented of the use, especially by
the North American Indians, of tribal signs carved or painted on rock,
tree, bark, skin, and other materials, and suggestion is made of an
interesting connection between these designs and those of heraldry in
Europe. It would, therefore, seem natural that the same Indians who
probably for ages used such totemic and tribal devices should paint or
tattoo them on their own persons, and the meagerness of the evidence
that they actually did so is surprising. Undoubtedly the statement
has been made in a general way by some of the earlier explorers and
travelers, but when analyzed it is frequently little more than a vague
expression of opinion, perhaps based on a preconceived theory. Nearly
all the Indian tribes have peculiarities of arrangement of the hair and
of some article of apparel and accouterment by which they can always
be distinguished. These are not totemic, nor are they by design expressions
of a tribal character. They come under the heading of fashion,
and such fashions in clothing and in arrangement of the hair still exist
among civilized peoples, so that the people of one nation or province can
at once be distinguished from others. Very little appears from the
account of actual observers to show that the character of the tattoo
marks of the North American Indians, perhaps excluding those of the
northwest coast, was more than a tribal fashion. Such styles or
fashions with no intent or deliberate purpose that they should serve as
tribal signs prevail to-day in Africa and in some other regions, and
have been introduced by the professional artists who had several
styles. Besides the necessary influence of a school of artists, it is
obvious that people living together would contract and maintain the
same custom and fashion in their cutaneous decoration.</p>


<h3>SECTION 4.<br />

<span class="subhead">DESIGNATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS.</span></h3>

<p>These are divided into: (1) Insignia or tokens of authority. (2) Signs
of individual achievements. (3) Property marks. (4) Personal names.</p>


<h4>INSIGNIA OR TOKENS OF AUTHORITY.</h4>

<p>Champlain (<i>e</i>) says of the Iroquois in 1609:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Those who wore three large “pannaches” [plumes] were the chiefs, and the three
chiefs delineated have their plumes much larger than those of their companions who
were simple warriors.</p></div>

<p>In Travels of Lewis and Clarke (<i>a</i>) it is said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420">[420]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the Teton Sioux the interior police of a village is confided to two or three
officers who are named by the chief for the purpose of preserving order, and remain
in power some days, at least till the chief appoints a successor; they seem to be a
sort of constable or sentinel, since they are always on the watch to keep tranquility
during the day and guarding the camp in the night. * * * Their distinguishing
mark is a collection of two or three raven skins fixed to the girdle behind the back
in such a way that the tails stick out horizontally from the body. On the head too
is a raven skin split into two parts and tied so as to let the beak project from the
forehead.</p></div>

<p>In James’s Long (<i>d</i>) it is reported <span class="lock">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the Omaha on all occasions of public rejoicings, festivals, dances, or general
hunts, a certain number of resolute warriors are previously appointed to preserve
order and keep the peace. In token of their office they paint themselves entirely
black; usually wear the crow, and arm themselves with a whip or war-club with
which they punish on the spot those who misbehave, and are at once both judges
and executioners.</p></div>

<p>Prince Maximilian of Wied (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In every numerous war party there are four leaders (partisans, karokkanakah)
sometimes seven, but only four are reckoned as the real partisans; the others are
called bad partisans (karokkanakah-chakohosch, literally, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partisans galeux</span>). All
partisans carry on their backs a medicine pipe in a case which other warriors dare
not have. To become a chief (Numakschi) a man must have been a partisan and
then kill an enemy when he is not a partisan. If he follows another partisan for
the second time he must have first discovered the enemy, have killed one and then
possessed the hide of a white buffalo cow complete with the horns to pretend to the
title of chief (Numakschi). * * * All the warriors wear small war pipes round
their necks, which are often very elegantly ornamented with porcupine quills.</p></div>

<p>Pls. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXVI</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">XXVII</span> are illustrations specially relating to insignia of
office selected from an important and unique pictorial roster of the heads
of Oglala families, eighty-four in number, in the band of Chief Big-Road,
which were obtained by Rev. S. D. Hinman at Standing Rock Agency,
Dakota, in 1883, from the United States Indian agent, Maj. McLaughlin,
to whom the original had been delivered by Chief Big-Road when
brought to that agency and required to give an account of his followers.
Other selections from this Oglala Roster appear under the headings of
Ideography, Personal names, Comparisons, Customs, Gestures, Religion,
and Conventionalizing.</p>

<p>Chief Big Road and his people belong to the northern Oglala, and at
the time mentioned had been lately associated with Sitting-Bull in various
depredations and hostilities against settlers and the United States
authorities. The translations of the names have been verified and the
Oglala name attached. At the date of the roster Chief Big-Road was
above 50 years old, and was as ignorant and uncompromising a savage
in mind and appearance, as one could well find.</p>

<p>The drawings in the original are on a single sheet of foolscap paper,
made with black and colored pencils, and a few characters are in yellow-ocher
waters color paint. They were made for the occasion with the

distinct from the others. The use of pipes as insignia for leaders is
frequently mentioned in this work. The five chiefs do not have the
war club, their rank being shown by pipe and pouch. Each of the
five chiefs has at least three transverse bands on the cheek, with differentiations
of the pattern.</p>

<p>The other male figures not represented in the plates have in general
each but a single red band on the cheek; others, two bands, red and
blue. These are merely ornamental and without significance.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that in this series the device indicating the name
is not generally connected by lines with the mouth but only when there
is a natural connection with it. It appears attached by a line to the
crown of the head, but sometimes without any connecting line.</p>

<p>Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXVI</span> shows the five principal chiefs of the Oglala in 1883, who are
severally designated as follows:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Cankutanka, Big-Road. Big-Road is often called Good-Road because
a road that is big or broad and well traveled is good. The tracks
on both sides of the line indicating a mere path show that the road is
big. The bird flying through the dusk indicates the rapidity of travel
which the good road allows. This is the same chief as the following:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 540.</span>&mdash;Big-Road.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 540, Big-Road as appearing in Red-Cloud’s
Census, No. 96. The broad and big road is indicated
by the artist of that series as having distinctly marked
sides and horsetracks between these roadsides. In
this instance as in several others it is obvious that
the ideographic device was not fixed but elastic and
subject to variation, the intention being solely to preserve
the idea.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Sunka-kuciyela, Low-Dog. The dog figure is represented as “low”
by the shortness of the legs as compared with the next figure of Long-Dog.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Sunka-hanska, Long-Dog. This term “long” is in the pictography
of the Siouan tribes, but is differently translated as tall. There is a
marked variation in the length of the legs between this and the next
foregoing.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Kangi-maza, Iron-Crow. The term “iron” is explained above.
The color blue is always used in Dakotan pictography for the word
translated as iron.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Cetan-cigala, Little-Hawk.</p>

<p>Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXVII</span> shows the subchiefs or partisans of the Oglala at the time
of the roster in 1883.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p><i>a.</i> Represents Tatanka-he-luta, Red-horn-Bull. The bull’s horns have
been made bloody by goring.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Represents Cetan-watakpe, Charging-Hawk. This subchief also
appears with a slightly different form of “charging” in Red-Cloud’s
Census, in which the bird is represented head downward.</p>

<p>Fig. 541.&mdash;Charging-Hawk, from Red-Cloud’s Census,
No. 142. On careful examination the bird is seen to be
not erect, as at first appears, but is swooping down.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Represents Wiyaka-aopazan, Wears-the-Feather. The feather in
its conventional form is presented twice, once connected by a line with
the mouth and also over the war club as in common with other pictures
of this series. The same person is represented next below.</p>

<p>Fig. 542.&mdash;Feather-on-his-Head, from Red-Cloud’s Census,
No. 86. In this case the feather droops while it is
erect in the figure next above. No significance is indicated
in the slight variation.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Represents Pankeskahoksila, Shell-Boy. The shell is the circular
object over the head of the small human figure, which is without the
proper number of legs, showing perhaps that he can not march, and
his open, weaponless hands say that he is not a warrior, i. e., he is a
boy. The object, now translated shell, was originally a large excrescence
on the trunk of a tree which was often cut away by the Dakotas,
hollowed out and used as a bowl.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Mato-niyanpi, The-Bear-spares-him. The bear passing through
the marks of several tracks indicates an incident not explained, in
which the subchief was in danger.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> Represents Cetan-maza, Iron-Hawk. The bird is colored blue, as
before explained.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Represents Kangi-luta, Red-Crow.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> Represents Situpi-ska, White-Tail. The bird is probably one of
the hawks, as is more distinctly indicated in the representation of the
same name as follows:</p>

<p>Fig. 545.&mdash;Standing-Bear; from Red-Cloud’s Census,
No. 140. This is probably the same man as in the last-mentioned
figure, though the fancy of the artist has
blazoned the bear as demi. This was, however, for convenience
and without special significance, as the forequarters
are not indicated in the name. But that might
well have been done if the device were strictly totemic
and connected with the taboo. Some of the bear gens
are only allowed to eat the fore quarters of the animal,
others the hind quarters.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 548 is a copy of a drawing made by Lean-Wolf, when second
chief of the Hidatsa, to represent himself. The horns on his head-dress
show that he is a chief. The eagle feathers on his war bonnet,
arranged in the special manner portrayed, also show high distinction
as a warrior. His authority as “partisan,” or leader of a war party, is
represented by the elevated pipe. His name is also added, with the
usual line drawn from the head. He explained the outline character
of the wolf, having a white body with the mouth unfinished, to show
that it was hollow, nothing there; i. e., lean. The animal’s tail is drawn
in detail and dark, to distinguish it from the body.</p>

<p>The character for “partisan” is also shown in Lone-Dog’s Winter
Count for the year 1842-’43.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 549.</span>&mdash;Micmac head dress in pictographs.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 549 gives three examples, actual size, of a large number of similar
designs scratched on the rocks of Kejimkoojik lake, Nova Scotia.
They were at first considered to be connected with the ceremonial or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425">[425]</a></span>
mystery lodges, many sketches of which appear on the same rocks, and
examples of which are given in Figs. <a href="#page509">717</a> and <a href="#page510">718</a>. Undoubtedly there
is some connection between the designs, but those now under consideration
are recognized by the Indians of the general locality as the elaborate
forms of head dress sometimes so extended as to become masks, which
are still worn by a few of the Micmac and Abnaki women. Those women
are or were of special authority and held positions in social and religious
ceremonies. Their ornamental head coverings therefore were insignia
of their rank. The modern specimens seen by the present writer are
elaborately wrought with beads, quills, and embroidery on fine cloth,
velvet or satin, but were originally of skin. The patterns still used
show some fantastic connection with those of the rock drawings of this
class, and again the latter reproduce some of the tracings on the ground
plans of the mystery lodges before mentioned. The feathery branches
of trees appearing on both of the two classes of illustrations are in the
modern head coverings actual feathers. The first of the three figures
shows the branch or feather inside of the pattern, and the other two
have them outside, in which variation the bushes or branches of the
medicine lodges show a similar proportion. The third sketch, in addition
to the exterior feathers, shows flags or streamers, which in the
ceremonial head gear in present use is imitated by ribbons.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 550.</span>&mdash;Micmac chieftainess in pictograph.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If there had been any doubt remaining of the interpretation of this
class of drawing it would be removed by the presence of a number of
contiguous and obviously contemporary sketches of which Fig. 550 is an
example. Here the female chieftain or, perhaps, priestess appears in a
ceremonial robe, with her head completely covered by one of these
capote masks. The researches made not only establish the significance
of this puzzling class of designs, but also show that their authors were
of the Abnaki or Micmac branches of the Algonquian linguistic family.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;">
<a href="images/dp511_pg427h.png">

</a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 551.</span>&mdash;Insignia traced on rocks, Nova Scotia.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The two lower drawings in Fig. 551 were printed from the Kejimkoojik
slate rocks, Nova Scotia, and are recognized by Micmacs of that
peninsula as copies of insignia which they say their chiefs used to wear.
The designs show some marks suggesting the artistic devices used in
the Roman Catholic Church, though the figuration of the cross is by no
means conclusive of European origin. The use of gorgets and other
ornaments bearing special designs, as insignia of rank and authority,
was well established, and it is quite possible that some of the Micmac
designs were affected by the influence of the early missionaries, who
indeed may have issued to the chiefs of their flock medals which adopted
the general aboriginal style, but were redeemed by Christian symbols.
There is no intrinsic evidence to decide whether these particular drawings
were or were not made before the arrival of the earliest French
missionaries.</p>

<p>The upper right-hand drawing of the three trees with peculiar devices<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427">[427]</a></span>
near their several roots was also printed from one of the Kejimkoojik
rocks. It became intelligible to the present writer after examination of a
silver disk in the possession of Mrs. W. Wallace Brown, of Calais, Maine,
which, not long before, had been owned by the head chief of the Passamaquoddy
tribe, whose title had been modernized into “governor.”
The disk, which is copied in the upper left-hand corner, was probably
not of Indian workmanship, but appeared to have been ordered from a
silversmith to be made from a Passamaquoddy design. It was known
to represent the three superior officers of the tribe mentioned and had
been worn by a former governor as a prized sign of his rank. The middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429">[429]</a></span>
device is for the governor and the right and left for the officers next
in rank to him. The devices at the roots of the trees of the drawing
before mentioned are noticeably similar. They may have been made,
as were most of the other characters on the Kejimkoojik rocks, by the
Micmacs, in which case it would seem that they designated their chiefs
by emblems similar to those used by their congeners of the Passamaquoddy
tribe or some member of the last-named tribe may have drawn
the emblem on the rocks in the Micmac territory. In any case there is
encouragement in the attempt to decipher petroglyphs from the fact that
the tree drawing in Nova Scotia, which seemed without significance,
was readily elucidated by a metal inscription found in Maine, the interpretation
being verified through living Indians, not only in the two
geographic divisions mentioned, but also by the Amalecites in New
Brunswick.</p>

<p>Father P. J. De Smet (<i>b</i>), referring to the Piegan and Blackfeet or
Satsika, describes the great Tail-Bearer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His tail, composed of buffalo and horse hair, is about 7 or 8 feet long, and instead
of wearing it behind, according to the usual fashion, it is fastened above his forehead
and there formed into a spiral coil resembling a rhinoceros’s horn. Such a tail among
the Blackfeet is a mark of greater distinction and bravery&mdash;in all probability the
larger the tail the braver the person.</p></div>

<p>The following description of a Chilkat ceremonial shirt, with the
illustration reproduced in Fig. 552, is taken from Niblack (<i>c</i>):</p>

wasko, a mythological animal of the wolf species. The edges and arm
holes are bordered with red cloth and the whole garment is neatly

although other tribes are more or less expert in weaving them. The warp is composed
of twisted cord or twine of cedar bark fiber, and the woof of worsted spun
from the wool of the mountain goat. Brown, yellow, black, and white are the colors
used, and these are skillfully wrought into a pattern representing the totem or a
totemic legend of the owner.</p></div>

them captains and generals of their forces or as officers of dispatch
[similar to aids-de-camp] to execute their orders, whether they related
to the affairs of their own kingdom or to those of the other vassal
states, who promptly obeyed without in any manner deviating from
the commands which they had received. The two selected are shown
in the present Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXIX</span>, viz: <i>c</i>, Ezguaguacatl, an officer of dispatch,
and <i>d</i>, Tocinltecatl, a man of distinguished courage in war and one of
the officers who filled the post of generals of the Mexican armies.</p>

<p>Wiener (<i>b</i>), p. 763, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Passing in review the numerous delineations of men on the different tissues in the
Peruvian graves, it is to be remarked that a chief is always recognized by a panache,
which for the decurion has two plumes, for the centurion four, for the chief of a thousand
men six, and the colors of these plumes indicate civil or military functions.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>A. W. Howitt (<i>e</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Messengers in central Australia sent to form a Pinya to avenge a death wear a
kind of net on the head and a white frontlet in which is stuck a feather. The messenger
is painted with yellow ochre and pipeclay and bears a bunch of emu feathers
stuck in his girdle at the back, at the spine. He carries part of the deceased’s beard
or some balls of pipeclay from the head of one of those mourning for him. These
are shown at the destination of the messenger and are at once understood.</p></div>

<p>The same author, p. 78, reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A third party which the Dieri sent out was the dreaded Pinya. It was the avenger
of the dead, of those who were believed to have been done to death by sorcery.</p>

<p>The appearance at a camp of one or more men marked each with a white band
round the head, with diagonal white and red stripes across the breast and stomach,
and with the point of the beard tied up and tipped with human hair, is the sign of
a Pinya being about. These men do not converse on ordinary matters, and their
appearance is a warning to the camp to listen attentively and to reply truly to such
questions as may be put concerning the whereabouts of the condemned man. Knowing
the remorseless spirit of the Pinya, any and every question is answered in terror.</p></div>


<h4>SIGNS OF INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENTS.</h4>

<p>Prince Maximilian of Wied, (<i>b</i>) gives an account explanatory of Figs.
558 and 559:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 559.</span>&mdash;Killed with fist. Dakota.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Sioux highly prize personal bravery, and therefore constantly wear the marks
of distinction which they have received for their exploits; among these are, especially,
tufts of human hair attached to the arms and legs, and feathers on their heads.
He who, in the sight of the adversaries, touches a slain or living enemy places a
feather horizontally in his hair for this exploit.</p>

<p>They look upon this as a very distinguished act, for many are killed in the attempt
before the object is attained. He who kills an enemy by a blow with his fist sticks
a feather upright in his hair.</p>

<p>If the enemy is killed with a musket a small piece of wood is put in the hair, which
is intended to represent a ramrod. If a warrior is distinguished by many deeds he
has a right to wear the great feather-cap with ox-horns. This cap, composed of
eagle feathers, which are fastened to a long strip of red cloth hanging down the
back, is highly valued by all the tribes on the Missouri. * * * Whoever first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434">[434]</a></span>
discovers the enemy and gives notice to his comrades of their approach is allowed to
wear a small feather which is stripped except towards the top.</p></div>

<p>The following scheme, used by the Dakotas, is taken from Mrs. Eastman’s
Dahcotah. Colors are not given, but red undoubtedly predominates,
as is known from personal observation.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 566.</span>&mdash;Many wounds. Dakota.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 566 denotes that the wearer has been wounded in many places
by the enemy.</p>

<p>The following variations in the scheme were noticed in 1883 among
the Mdewakantanwan Dakotas, near Fort Snelling, Minnesota.</p>

<p>Feathers of the eagle are used as among the other bands of Dakotas.</p>

<p>A plain feather is used to signify that the wearer has killed an
enemy, without regard to the manner in which he was slain.</p>

<p>When the end is clipped transversely, and the edge colored red, it
signifies that the throat of the enemy was cut.</p>

<p>A black feather denotes that an Ojibwa woman was killed. Enemies
are considered as Ojibwas, that being the tribe with which the
Mdewakantanwan Dakotas have been most in collision.</p>

<p>When a warrior has been wounded a red spot is painted upon the
broad side of a feather. If the wearer has been shot in the body, arms,
or legs, a red spot is painted upon his clothing or blanket, immediately
over the locality of the wound. These red spots are sometimes worked
in porcupine quills, or in cotton fiber as now obtained from the traders.</p>

<p>Belden (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the Sioux an eagle’s feather with a red spot painted on it, worn by a warrior
in the village, denotes that on the last war-path he killed an enemy, and for
every additional enemy he has slain he carries another feather painted with an
additional red spot about the size of a silver quarter.</p>

<p>A red hand painted on a warrior’s blanket denotes that he has been wounded by
the enemy, and a black one that he has been unfortunate in some way.</p></div>

<p>Boller (<i>a</i>) in Among the Indians, p. 284, describes a Sioux as wearing
a number of small wood shavings stained with vermilion in his hair,
each the symbol of a wound received.</p>

<p>Lynd (<i>c</i>) gives a device differing from all the foregoing, with an explanation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the human body the Dakotas give four spirits. The first is supposed to be a
spirit of the body, and dies with the body. The second is a spirit which always
remains with or near the body. Another is the soul which accounts for the deeds
of the body, and is supposed by some to go to the south, by others to the west, after
the death of the body. The fourth always lingers with the small bundle of the hair
of the deceased kept by the relatives until they have a chance to throw it into the
enemy’s country, when it becomes a roving, restless spirit, bringing death and disease
to the enemy whose country it is in.</p>

<p>From this belief arose the practice of wearing four scalp-feathers for each enemy
slain in battle, one for each soul.</p></div>

<p>It should be noted that all the foregoing signs of individual achievements
are given by the several authorities as used by the same body
of Indians, the Dakota or Sioux. This, however, is a large body, divided
into tribes, and it is possible that a different scheme was used in
the several tribes. But the accounts are so conflicting that error in
either observation or description or both is to be suspected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>Rev. J. Owen Dorsey (<i>b</i>) explains the devices on the shield of a
Teton Dakota:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>* * * The three pipes on the shield, in a colored sketch prepared by Bushotter,
denote that on so many expeditions he carried a war pipe. The red stripes declare
how many of the enemy were wounded by him, and the human heads show the
number of foes that he killed. The half moon means that he shouted at his
foes on a certain night. Once he threw aside his arms and engaged in a hand-to-hand
struggle with a foe; this is shown by the human hand. The horse tracks indicate
that he ran off with so many horses. If his name was Black Hawk, for instance,
a black hawk was painted in the middle of his shield.</p></div>

<p>Irving (<i>a</i>), in Astoria, says of the Arikara:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He who has killed an enemy in his own land is entitled to drag at his heels a fox
skin attached to each moccasin; and he who has slain a grizzly bear wears a necklace
of his claws, the most glorious trophy that a hunter can exhibit.</p></div>

<p>Prince Maximilian, of Wied (<i>c</i>), thus reports on the designations of
the Mandans connected with the present topic:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Mandans wear the large horned feather cap; this is a cap consisting of strips
of white ermine with pieces of red cloth hanging down behind as far as the calves of
the legs, to which is attached an upright row of black and white eagle feathers,
beginning at the head and reaching to the whole length. Only distinguished warriors
who have performed many exploits may wear this headdress.</p>

<p>If the Mandans give away one or more of these headdresses, which they estimate
very highly, they are immediately considered men of great importance. * * *
On their buffalo robes they often represent this feather cap under the image of a
sun. Very celebrated and eminent warriors, when most highly decorated, wear in
their hair various pieces of wood as signals of their wounds and heroic deeds. Thus
Mato-Topé had fastened transversely in his hair a wooden knife painted red and
about the length of a hand, because he had killed a Cheyenne chief with his knife;
then six wooden sticks, painted red, blue, and yellow, with a brass nail at one end,
indicating so many musket wounds which he had received. For an arrow wound
he fastened in his hair the wing feather of a wild turkey; at the back of his head
he wore a large bunch of owl’s feathers, dyed yellow, with red tips, as the badge of the
Meniss-Ochata (the dog band). The half of his face was painted red and the other
yellow; his body was painted reddish-brown, with narrow stripes, which were produced
by taking off the color with the tip of the finger wetted. On his arms, from
the shoulder downwards, he had seventeen yellow stripes, which indicated his warlike
deeds, and on his breast the figure of a hand, of a yellow color, as a sign that
he had captured some prisoners.</p>

<p>* * * A Mandan may have performed many exploits and yet not be allowed to
wear tufts of hair on his clothes, unless he carries a medicine pipe and has been the
leader of a war party. When a young man who has never performed an exploit is
the first to kill an enemy on a warlike expedition he paints a spiral line round his
arm, of whatever color he pleases, and he may then wear a whole wolf’s tail at the
ankle or heel of one foot. If he has first killed and touched the enemy he paints a
line running obliquely round the arm and another crossing it in the opposite direction,
with three transverse stripes. On killing the second enemy he paints his left
leg (that is, the leggin) a reddish-brown. If he kills the second enemy before
another is killed by his comrades he may wear two entire wolves’ tails at his heels.
On his third exploit he paints two longitudinal stripes on his arms and three transverse
stripes. This is the exploit that is esteemed the highest; after the third
exploit no more marks are made. If he kills an enemy after others of the party have
done the same he may wear on his heel one wolf’s tail, the tip of which is cut off.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hidatsa scheme of designating achievements was obtained by
Dr. Hoffman, at Fort Berthold, North Dakota, during 1881, and now
follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/dp525_pg437a.png" width="450" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 567.</span>&mdash;Marks of exploits, Hidatsa.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A feather, to the tip of which is attached a tuft of down or several
strands of horse hair, dyed red, denotes
that the wearer has killed an enemy
and that he was the first to touch or
strike him with the coup stick. Fig.
567 <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>A feather bearing one red bar made
with vermillion, signifies the wearer to
have been the second person to strike
the fallen enemy with the coup stick.
Same Fig. <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>A feather bearing two red bars signifies
that the wearer was the third
person to strike the body. Same
Fig. <i>c</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/dp525_pg437b.png" width="580" height="638" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 568.</span>&mdash;Marks of exploits, Hidatsa.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A feather with three bars signifies
that the wearer was the fourth to
strike the fallen enemy. Fig. 568 <i>a</i>.  Beyond this number honors are
not counted.</p>

<p>A red feather denotes that the wearer was wounded in an encounter
with an enemy. Fig. 568 <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>A narrow strip of rawhide or buckskin
is wrapped from end to end
with porcupine quills dyed red, though
sometimes a few white ones are inserted
to break the monotony of color.
This strip is attached to the inner
surface of the rib or shaft of the quill
by means of very thin fibers of sinew,
and signifies that the wearer killed a
woman belonging to a hostile tribe.
It is shown in Fig. 568 <i>c</i>. In very
fine specimens the quills are directly
applied to the shaft without resorting
to the strap of leather.</p>

<p>Similar marks denoting exploits are used by the Hidatsa, Mandan,
and Arikara Indians. The Hidatsa claim to have been the originators
of the devices.</p>

<p>The following characters are marked upon robes and blankets, usually
in red or blue colors, and often upon the boat paddles. Frequently an
Indian has them painted upon his thighs, though this is generally
resorted to only on festal occasions or for dancing.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 569 denotes that the wearer successfully defended
himself against the enemy by throwing up a ridge of earth
or sand to protect the body. The manner of depicting this
mark upon the person or clothing is shown in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page440">XXX</a></span> upon

<p>Fig. 570 signifies that the wearer has upon two different
occasions defended himself by hiding his body within low
earthworks. The character is merely a compound of two
of the preceding marks placed together. Both of the devices
shown in Figs. 569 and 570 are displayed on the clothing in
Fig. 575, drawn by a Hidatsa.</p>

<p>Fig. 571 signifies that the one who carries this mark upon
his blanket, leggings, boat paddle, or any other property,
or upon his person, has distinguished himself by capturing
a horse belonging to a hostile tribe. This character appears
upon the garments and legs of several of the human figures

<p>In Fig. 572, <i>a</i> signifies among the Hidatsa and Mandans that the
wearer was the first person to strike a fallen enemy with a coup stick.
It signifies among the Arikara simply that the wearer killed an enemy.</p>

<p><i>b</i> represents among the Hidatsa and Mandans the second person to
strike a fallen enemy. It represents among the Arikara the first person
to strike the fallen enemy.</p>

Hidatsa and Mandan; the second person to strike him according to the
Arikara.</p>

<p><i>d</i> shows among the Hidatsa and Mandan the fourth person to strike
the fallen enemy. This is the highest and last number; the fifth person
to risk the danger is considered brave for venturing so near the
ground held by the enemy, but has no right to wear a mark therefor.</p>

<p>The same mark among the Arikara represents the person to be the
third to strike the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p><i>e</i>, according to the Arikara, represents the fourth person to strike
the enemy.</p>

<p>According to the Hidatsa, the wearer of the mark <i>f</i> had figured in
four encounters; in those recorded by the marks in each of the two
lateral spaces he was the second to strike the fallen enemy, and the
marks in the upper and lower spaces signify that he was the third
person upon two other occasions.</p>

The fourth figure of the upper row shows the wearer to have been the
second person to strike an enemy upon four different occasions. Upon
the right-hand figure of the lower row two distinct marks will be
observed; that upon the wearer’s left leg indicating him to have been
the second to strike an enemy upon two different occasions; and the
mark upon the right leg, that he was twice the second person to strike
enemies, and twice the third person to perform that exploit.</p>

<p>Miss Agnes Crane (<i>a</i>), in an article on Ancient Mexican Heraldry,
seems to assert that the evidence of emblems in the western hemisphere
as boastful records of individual achievements is confined to Mexico.
The present section may supply the evidence lacking.</p>

<p>The following information regarding Winnebago devices of the
character now under consideration was given by St. Cyr, a mixed
blood Winnebago, in April, 1886.</p>

<p>To show that the wearer killed a man, strike the muddy hand upon
the body or horse. Clay of any kind is used. When 20 men have
been killed, an otter skin is worn on the back. A skunk skin worn on
the calf signifies a man killed.</p>

<p>Scented grass worn on the neck or the wrist shows that a prisoner
had been captured and tied with grass in the absence of other cords.</p>

<p>To show that the wearer had been wounded, cover the part of the
body with white clay, and indicate the spot with red paint.</p>

<p>Paul Kane (<i>a</i>) says that among the Cree Indians red earth was
spotted on a leg to indicate that the wearer had been wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>Prof. Dall (<i>b</i>) tells of the Sitka-Kwan:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They perforate their noses, wearing a ring adorned with feathers. They make a
succession of perforations all around the edge of the ears, which are ornamented
with scarlet thread, shark’s teeth, or pieces of shell. Each hole is usually the record
of a deed performed or a feast given by the person so adorned.</p></div>


<h4>PROPERTY MARKS.</h4>

<p>This topic, upon which much interesting material has been collected
in many geographic and ethnologic divisions of the earth, can not include
objectively or pictorially many genuine and distinctive illustrations
from the North American Indians. The reason for this paucity is that
the individual Indian had very little property. Nearly everything which
could be classed as personal property belonged to his tribe or, more generally,
to his clan or gens. Yet articles of a man’s personal manufacture,
such as arrows, were often marked in such a manner as to be distinguished.
Those marks, many examples of which are upon arrows in
the U. S. National Museum, are not of sufficient general interest to be
reproduced here. They are not valuable unless they are connected
with the makers or owners by a concurrence of the devices with the signs
adopted by persons or by classes, the evidence of which can not now
except in rare instances be procured. Most of the devices mentioned
seem to have degenerated into mere ornamentation, which might be
expected, because the arrows are not of great antiquity, and during
recent years the records which could have been used for their identification
have decayed as authorities even when they have remained in
the immediate family, having escaped sale and robbery.</p>

<p>As a general rule neither a man nor a family, in the modern sense,
had any property in land, which belonged to a much larger sociologic
division, but on their arrival in California Europeans noticed among
the Indians there a device to assert rights in realty by the use of distinctive
marks. It is not clear whether these marks were merely personal
or were tribal or gentile.</p>

<p>According to Mr. A. F. Coronel, of Los Angeles, California, the
Serrano Indians in that vicinity formerly practiced a method of marking
trees to indicate the corner boundaries of patches of land. The
Indians owning areas of territory of whatever size would cut lines upon
the bark of the tree corresponding to lines drawn on their own faces,
i. e., lines running outward and downward over the cheeks, or perhaps
over the chin only, tattooed in color. These lines were made on the
trees on the side facing the property, and were understandingly recognized
by the whole tribe. This custom still prevailed when Mr. Coronel
first located in southern California about the year 1843.</p>

<p>Among the Arikara Indians a custom prevails of drawing upon the
blade of a canoe or bull-boat paddle such designs as are worn by the
chief and owner to suggest his personal exploits. This has to great
extent been adopted by the Hidatsa and Mandans. The marks are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442">[442]</a></span>
chiefly horseshoes and crosses, as in Fig. 578, referring to the capture of
the enemy’s ponies and to coups in warfare. The entire tribe being intimately
acquainted with the courage and
actions of all its members, imposition and
fraud in the delineation of any character
are not attempted, as such would surely
be detected, and the impostor would be ridiculed if not ostracised.</p>

<p>The brands upon cattle in Texas and other regions of the United
States where ranches are common illustrate the modern use of
property marks. A collection of these brands made by the
writer compares unfavorably for individuality and ideography
with the genuine marks of Indians for similar purposes.</p>

<p>The following translation from <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kunst and Witz der Neger
in Das Ausland</span> (<i>a</i>), describing Fig. 579, is inserted for comparison:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whenever a pumpkin of surprisingly fine appearance is growing, which
promises to furnish a desirable water vase, the proprietor hurries to distinguish
it by cutting into it some special mark with his knife, and probably
superstitious feelings may coöperate in this act. I have reproduced
herewith the best types of such property marks which I have been able to
discover.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 580.</span>&mdash;Owner’s marks, Slesvick.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sir John Lubbock (<i>a</i>) tells that many of the arrows found at
Nydam, Slesvick, had owner’s marks on them, now reproduced
in Fig. 580 as <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, resembling those on the modern Esquimaux
arrows shown in the same figure as <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Prof. Anton Schiefner (<i>b</i>) gives a remarkable parallel between
the Runic alphabet and the property marks of the Finns,
Lapps, and Samoyeds.</p>


<h4>PERSONAL NAMES.</h4>

<p>The names of Indians as formerly adopted by or bestowed among themselves
were generally connotive.
They very often refer to some animal
and predicate an attribute or position
of that animal. On account of their
sometimes objective and sometimes
ideographic nature, they almost invariably
admit of being expressed in
sign language; and for the same reason
they can readily be portrayed in
pictographs. The device generally
adopted by the Dakotan tribes to signify
that an object drawn in connection
with a human figure was a totemic
or a personal name of the individual,
is to connect that object with
the figure by a line drawn to the head or, more frequently, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443">[443]</a></span>
mouth of the latter. The same tribes make a distinction to manifest
that the gesture sign for an object gestured is intended to be the name
of a person and not introduced for any other purpose by passing the
index forward from the mouth in a direct line after the conclusion of
the sign for the object. This signifies “that is his name,” the name of
the person referred to.</p>

<p>As a general rule, Indians were named in early infancy according to
a tribal system, but in later life each generally acquired a new name, or
perhaps several names in succession, from some special exploits or adventures.
Frequently a sobriquet is given which is not complimentary.
All of the names subsequently acquired as well as the original names
are so connected with material objects or with substantive actions as
to be expressible in a graphic picture and also in a pictorial sign. In
the want of alphabet or syllabary they used the same expedient to distinguish
the European invaders. A Virginian was styled Assarigoa,
“Big Knife.” The authorities of Massachusetts were called by the
Iroquois, Kinshon, “a fish,” doubtless in allusion to the cod industry
and the fact that a wooden codfish then hung, as it did long afterwards,
in the state house at Boston, as an emblem of the colony and state.</p>

<p>The determination to use names of this connotive character is shown
by the objective translation, whenever possible, of such European
names as it became necessary for them to introduce frequently into
their speech. William Penn was called Onas, that being the word for
feather-quill in the Mohawk dialect. The name of the second French
governor of Canada was De Montmagny, erroneously translated to be
“great mountain,” which words were correctly translated by the Iroquois
into Onontio, and this expression becoming associated with the
title has been applied to all successive Canadian governors, though the
origin having been generally forgotten, it has been considered to be a
metaphorical compliment.</p>

<p>The persistence of titles is shown by the fact that the Abnaki of
New Brunswick to-day call Queen Victoria, “King James,” with a feminine
addition.</p>

<p>Gov. Fletcher was named by the Iroquois Cajenquiragoe, “the great
swift arrow,” not because of his speedy arrival at a critical time, as
has been supposed, but because they had somehow been informed of
the etymology of his name, “arrow-maker” (Fr. fléchier). A notable
example of the adoption of a graphic illustration from a similarity in
the sound of the name to known English words is given in the present
paper, in Fig. <a href="#page596">919</a>, where Gen. Maynadier is represented as “many
deer.”</p>

<p>While, as before said, some tribes give names to children from considerations
of birth and kinship according to a fixed rule, others conferred
them after solemn deliberation. Even these were not necessarily
permanent. A diminutive form is frequently bestowed by the affection of
the parent. On initiation into one of the cult associations a name is
generally received. Until this is established a warrior is liable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444">[444]</a></span>
change his name after every fight or hunt. He will sometimes only
acknowledge the name he has himself assumed, perhaps from a
dream or vision, though he may be habitually called by an entirely
different name. From that reason the same man is sometimes known
under several different epithets. Personal peculiarity, deformity, or
accident is sure to fix a name against which it is vain to struggle.
Girls do not often change names bestowed in their childhood. The
same precise name is often given to different individuals in the same
tribe, but not so frequently in the same band, whereby the inconvenience
would be increased. For this reason it is often necessary
to specify the band, sometimes also the father. For instance, when
the writer asked an Indian who Black-Stone, a chief mentioned in
the Lone-Dog winter counts, was, the Indian asked, first, what tribe
was he; then, what band; then, who was his father; and, except in the
case of very noted persons, the identity is not proved without an answer
to these questions. A striking instance of this plurality of names
among the Dakotas was connected with the name Sitting-Bull, belonging
to the leader of the hostile band, while one of that name was almost
equally noted as being the head soldier of the friendly Dakotas at Red-Cloud
Agency.</p>

<p>The northeastern tribes sometimes formally resurrected the name
of the dead and also revived it by adoption. See Jes. Rel., 1639, p. 45,
and 1642, p. 53.</p>

<p>Among the peculiarities connected with Indian personal names, far
too many for discussion here, is their avoidance of them in direct address,
terms of kinship or relative age taking their place. Maj. J. W.
Powell states that at one time he had the Kaibab Indians, a small
tribe of northern Arizona, traveling with him. The young chief was
called by white men “Frank.” For several weeks he refused to give
his Indian name and Maj. Powell endeavored to discover it by noticing
the term by which he was addressed by the other Indians, but invariably
some kinship term was employed. One day in a quarrel his wife
called him Chuarumpik (“Yucca-heart”). Subsequently Maj. Powell
questioned the young chief about the matter, who explained and apologized
for the great insult which his wife had given him and said that
she was excused by great provocation. The insult consisted in calling
the man by his real name.</p>

<p>Everard F. im Thurn (<i>g</i>) gives the following account of the name-system
of the Indians of Guiana, which might have been written with
equal truth about some tribes of North America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The system under which the Indians have their personal names is intricate and
difficult to explain. In the first place, a name, which may be called the proper name,
is always given to a young child soon after birth. It is said to be proper that the
peaiman, or medicine-man, should choose and give this name, but, at any rate now,
the naming seems more often left to the parents. The word selected is generally the
name of some plant, bird, or other natural object. But these names seem of little
use, in that owners have a very strong objection to telling or using them, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445">[445]</a></span>
on the ground that the name is part of the man, and that he who knows the
name has part of the owner of that name in his power.
One Indian, therefore, generally addresses another only according to the relationship
of the caller and the called, as brother, sister, father, mother, and so on. These
terms, therefore, practically form the names actually used by Indians amongst themselves.
But an Indian is just as unwilling to tell his proper name to a white man
as to an Indian, and, of course, between the Indian and the white man there is no
relationship the term for which can serve as a proper name. An Indian, therefore,
when he has to do with a European, asks the latter to give him a name, and if one
is given to him always afterwards uses this. The names given in this way are generally
simple enough&mdash;John, Peter, Thomas, and so on.</p></div>

showing the manner in which the wolf, proverbially a lean animal, was
delineated by Germans in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It
is taken from Rudolf Cronau (<i>b</i>), whose remarks are translated and
condensed as follows:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The oldest representation known to me of the “wolf” occurs on a
Gothic sword of the thirteenth century, in the Historical Museum of
Dresden.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Is more primitive, from a sword of the last half of the fourteenth
century, in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Berliner Zeughause</span>;” also similar to <i>c</i>, of the same
period, from a specimen in the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Züricher Zeughaus</span>.</p>

<p><i>d</i> and <i>e</i>. Signatures on two specimens in the collection in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Feste Coburg</span>;
<i>e</i> is a rare representation of the figure of the wolf of 1490, in the
Germanic Museum at Nürnberg, and still more intricate (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">verzwickter</span>)
is the drawing <i>f</i> on a Dresden specimen of the year 1559.</p>

</div>

<p>A large proportion of the pictographs of several names next to be
presented are from Red-Cloud’s Census, the history of which is as
follows:</p>

<p>A pictorial census was prepared in 1884 under the direction of Red-Cloud,
chief of the Dakota at Pine Ridge Agency, Dakota Territory.
The 289 persons enumerated, many of whom were heads of families,
were the adherents of Red-Cloud and did not represent all the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446">[446]</a></span>
at that agency. Owing to a disagreement the agent refused to acknowledge
that chief as head of the Indians at the agency, and named another
as the official chief. Many of the Indians exhibited their allegiance to
Red-Cloud by having their names attached in their own pictorial style
to a document showing their votes and number. This filled seven
sheets of ordinary manila paper and was sent to Washington. While
in the custody of Dr. T. A. Bland, of that city, it was loaned by him to
the Bureau of Ethnology to be copied by photography. The different
sheets were apparently drawn by different persons, as the drawings of
human heads vary enough to indicate individuality. This arrangement
seems to imply seven bands or, perhaps, gentes.</p>

<p>Dr. V. T. McGillicuddy, who at the time was Indian agent at Pine
Ridge Agency, Dakota, in correspondence gives the impression that the
several pictographs representing names were attached as signatures
by the several individuals to a subscription list for Dr. Bland, before
mentioned, who was the editor of The Council Fire, in support of that
publication and with an agreement that each should give 25 cents.
The document in that view would be a subscription list, but the subscribers
were, in fact, the adherents of Red-Cloud. Whatever was the
motive for this collection of pictured names, its interest consists in
the mode of their portrayal, together with the assurance that they were
the spontaneous and genuine work of the Indians concerned.</p>

<p>In addition to the personal names which immediately follow, a considerable
number of the 289 pictographic names appear elsewhere in
this paper under the various heads of Tribal Designations, Ideography,
Conventionalizing, Customs, special Comparison, etc.</p>

<p>Interspersed among the personal names taken from the above mentioned
list are others selected from the Oglala Roster, the origin of
which is explained above, and the several winter counts of The-Flame,
The-Swan, American-Horse, and Cloud-Shield, mentioned, respectively,
in Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase">X</span>, Sec. <a href="#page266">2</a>. The authority is in each case attached to the pictograph
with the translation of the Indian name, and in some cases with
the name in the original.</p>

<p>Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, in Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXIV</span> of the Proceedings of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science and in the American
Anthropologist for July, 1890, gives valuable notes on the subject of
Indian personal names and also has made oral suggestions to the present
writer. Some of those may be considered with reference to the list
now presented. He thinks that the frequent use of color names is
from a mythical or symbolic significance attributed to the colors.
Also the word translated “iron,” or “metal,” is connected with the
color blue, the object called iron being always painted blue when
colors are used, and that color is mystically connected with the water
powers of the Dakotan mythology. The frequent use of the terms
“Little” and “Big,” with or without graphic differentiation, may be
as the terms young and old, junior and senior, are employed by civilized
people, but the expressions in other cases may refer to the size<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447">[447]</a></span>
of the animals seen in the visions of fasting which have determined
the names.</p>

<p>Explanations on parts of the pictographs not strictly connected with
the personal name are annexed for the reason before indicated and the
objects connected by the names are to some extent arranged in classes.</p>

<p>With regard to the errors arising from bad translation, an example
may be given, relating to a name the explanation of which has often
been asked. A former chief of the Oglala was called “Old-man-afraid-of-his-Horses,”
by the whites, and his son is known as “Young-man-afraid-of-his-Horses.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459">[459]</a></span>
A common interpretation about “afraid-of-his-horses”
is that the man valued his horses so much that he was afraid
of losing them. The representative of the name, however, stated to the
writer that the correct name was Ta-shunka Kokipapi, and that the
true meaning was “He-whose-horse-they-fear”; literally “His-horse-they-fear-it.”</p>

<p>A large number of pictorially rendered Indian names attached to
deeds and treaties have been published, e. g., in Documents relating to
the Colonial History of New York (<i>b</i>). Few of them are of interest,
and they generally suggest the assistance of practiced penmen. In the
collections mentioned some of the Dutch marks are in the same general
style as those of the Indians.</p>

<p>Mr. P. W. Norris, late of the Bureau of Ethnology, had a buffalo robe
containing a record of exploits, which was drawn by Black-Crow, a Dakota
warrior. The successful warrior is represented in each instance
upright, the accompanying figure being always in a recumbent posture,
representing the enemy who was slain. The peculiar feature of these
pictographs is that instead of depicting the victim’s personal name with
a connecting line, the object denoting his name is placed above the
head of the victor in each instance, and a line connects the character
with his mouth. The latter thus seems to proclaim the name of his
victim. A pipe is also figured between the victor and the vanquished,
showing that he is entitled to smoke a pipe of celebration.</p>

<p>A copy of the whole record was shown to the Mdewakantanwan Dakotas,
near Fort Snelling, Minnesota, in 1883, and the character reproduced
in Fig. 638, about which there was the most doubt, was explained
as signifying “many tongues,” or Loud-Talker.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 638.</span>&mdash;Loud-Talker.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The circle at the end of the line running from the mouth contains a
number of lanceolate forms, one-half of each of which is black, the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460">[460]</a></span>
white. They have the appearance of feathers, but also may represent
tongues and signify voice, sound issuing from the mouth, and correspond
in some respect to those drawn by the Mexicans with that significance,
of which examples are given in this work, Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase">XX</span>, Sec. <a href="#page692">2</a>.
The considerable number of these tongue-like figures suggests intensity
and denotes loud voice, or, as given literally, “loud talker,” that being
the name of the victim.</p>

<p>It is, however, to be noted that “Shield,” an Oglala Dakota, contends
that the character signifies Feather-Shield, the name of a warrior formerly
living at the Pine Ridge Agency, Dakota.</p>

<p>Designation of an object, as a name, by means of a connecting line
is mentioned in Kingsborough (<i>a</i>). Pedro de Alvarado, one of the
companions of Cortez, was red-headed. Designating him, the Mexicans
called him Tonatihu, the “Sun,” and in their picture-writing his name
was represented by their conventional character for the sun attached
to his person by a line.</p>

<p>Other examples are now presented both of the linear connection and
of the iconographic figuration by the old Mexicans.</p>

<p>In Kingsborough (<i>b</i>) is a pictograph of Chimalpopoca, which name
signifies a smoking shield, here reproduced as Fig. 639 (<i>a</i>). The smoking
shield is connected with the head by a line, and the form of smoke
should be noticed in comparison with the representation of flame and
of voice by the same pictors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="subhead">RELIGION.</span></h2>


<p>The most surprising fact relating to the North American Indians,
which until lately had not been realized, is that they habitually lived
in and by religion to a degree comparable with the old Israelites under
the theocracy. This was sometimes ignored, and sometimes denied in
terms, by many of the early missionaries and explorers. The aboriginal
religion was not their religion, and therefore was not recognized
to have an existence or was pronounced to be satanic. Many pictorial
representations are given in this chapter of concepts of the supernatural,
as operative in this world, which is popularly styled religion when
it is not condemned as superstition. The pictographic examples presented
from the Siouan stock are generally explained as they appear.
Those from the Ojibwa and other tribes are not so fully discussed. It
is therefore proper to mention explicitly that, in the several localities
where the tribes are now found which have been the least affected by
civilization, they in a marked degree live a life of religious practices,
and their shamans have a profound influence over their social character.
A careful study of these people has already given indication of
facts corresponding in interest with those which have recently surprised
the world as reported by Mr. Cushing from among the Zuñi and Dr.
Matthews from among the Navajo.</p>

<p>The most extensive and important publications on the subject have
been made by Maj. J. W. Powell (<i>a</i>), Director of the Bureau of Ethnology.
These have been made at many times and in various shapes,
from the Outlines of the Philosophy of the North American Indians,
read in 1876, to the present year.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of detail respecting religion appears in Chap.
<span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span>, Sections <a href="#page231">4</a> and <a href="#page250">5</a>, in the present work.</p>

<p>The discussion of the religions and religious practices of the tribes
of America is not germane to the present work, except so far as it elucidates
their pictographs. In that connection it may be mentioned that
the tribes of Indians in the territory of the United States, which have
been converted to Christianity, seem not to have spontaneously turned
their pictographic skill to the representation of objects connected with
the religion to which they have been converted. This might be explained
by the statement, often true, that the converts have been taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462">[462]</a></span>
to read and write the languages of their teachers in religion, and therefore
ceased to be pictographers. But where they have not been so instructed,
indeed have been encouraged to retain their own language and to write
it in a special manner supposed to be adapted to their ancient methods,
the same result is observed. The Micmacs still with delight draw on
bark their stories of Glooscap and Lox, and scenes from the myths of
their old faith, but unless paid as for a piece of work, do not produce
Christian pictures. This assertion does not conflict with the account
of the “Micmac hieroglyphs” in Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase">XIX</span>, Sec. <a href="#page664">2</a>. All the existing
specimens of these were made by Europeans, and the action of the first
Indian converts, which was imitated by Europeans, was the simple use
of their old scheme of mnemotechny to assist in memorizing the lessons
required of them by missionaries. It is also to be noted that some
tribes for convenience have adopted Christian emblems into their own
ceremonial pictographs (see Fig. <a href="#page208">159</a>).</p>

<p>It has been found convenient to divide this chapter into the following
sections: (1) Symbols of the supernatural. (2) Myths and mythic
animals. (3) Shamanism. (4) Charms and amulets. (5) Religious
ceremonies. (6) Mortuary practices.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">SYMBOLS OF THE SUPERNATURAL.</span></h3>

<p>This group shows the modes of expressing the idea of the supernatural,
holy, sacred, or, more correctly, the mystic or unknown (perhaps
unknowable), that being the true translation of the Dakota word waka<sup>n</sup>.
The concept of “crazy,” in the sense of influenced by superior powers
or inspired, is in the same connection. Not only the North American
Indians, but many tribes of Asia and Africa, consider a demented person
to be sacred and therefore inviolable. The spiral line is but a
pictorial representation of the sign for waka<sup>n</sup>, which is: With its index
finger extended and pointing upward, or all the fingers extended, back
of hand outward, move the right hand from just in front of the forehead
spirally upward nearly to arm’s length from left to right.</p>

<p>Hoofprints and lodge-pole tracks run northward
from the house, which represents the agency. That
the horse is “crazy” is shown by the waved or spiral
lines on his body, running from his nose, hoof, and
forehead. The band is named from its deceased
chief, and is designated by his personal device, a distinct
and unusual departure among Indians tending
towards the evolution of band or party emblems unconnected
with the gentile system.</p>

Count for the same year as follows:</p>

<p>“Left-the-heyoka-man-behind winter.” A certain
man was heyoka, that is, in a disordered
frame of mind, and went about the village
bedecked with feathers singing to himself, and
while so joined a war party. On sighting the
enemy the party fled and called to him to turn
back also, but as he was heyoka he construed
everything that was said to him as meaning the
very opposite, and, therefore, instead of turning back he went forward
and was killed. This conception of a man under superhuman influence
being obliged to believe or speak the reverse of the truth is not uncommon
among the Indians. See Leland (<i>a</i>) Algonquin Legends.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 653.</span>&mdash;Religious symbols.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 653: <i>a</i> is an Ojibwa pictograph taken from Schoolcraft representing
“medicine man,” “meda.” With these horns and spiral may be
collated <i>b</i> in the same figure, which portrays the ram-headed Egyptian
god Knuphis, or Chnum, the spirit, in a shrine on the boat of the sun,
canopied by the serpent goddess Ranno, who is also seen facing him
inside the shrine. This is reproduced from Cooper’s Serpent Myths (<i>a</i>).
The same deity is represented in Champollion (<i>a</i>) as reproduced in Fig.
653, <i>c</i>.</p>

<p><i>d</i> is an Ojibwa pictograph found in Schoolcraft (<i>i</i>) and given as
“power.” It corresponds with the Absaroka sign for “medicine man”
made by passing the extended and separated index and second finger
of the right hand upward from the forehead, spirally, and is considered
to indicate “superior knowledge.” Among the Otos, as part of the
sign with the same meaning, both hands are raised to the side of the
head and the extended indices pressing the temples.</p>

<p><i>e</i> is also an Ojibwa pictograph from Schoolcraft, same volume, Pl. 59,
and is said to signify Meda’s power. It corresponds with another sign
made for “medicine man” by the Absaroka and Comanche, viz, the
hand passed upward before the forehead, with index loosely extended.
Combined with the sign for “sky” it means knowledge of superior
matters, spiritual power.</p>

<p>In many parts of the United States and Canada rocks and large
stones are found which generally were decorated with paint and were
regarded as possessing supernatural power, yet, so far as ascertained,
were not directly connected with any special personage of Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467">[467]</a></span>
mythology. One of the earliest accounts of these painted stones was
made by the Abbé de Gallinée and is published in Margry (<i>d</i>). The
Abbé, with La Salle’s party in 1669, found on the Detroit river, six
leagues above Lake Erie, a large stone remotely resembling a human
figure and painted, the face made with red paint. All the Indians of
the region&mdash;Algonquian and Iroquoian&mdash;believed that the rock-image
could give safety in the passage of the lake, if properly placated, and
they never ventured on the passage without offering to it presents of
skins, food, tobacco, or like sacrifices. La Salle’s party, which had met
with misfortune, seems to have been so much impressed with the evil
powers of the image that they broke it into pieces.</p>

<p>Keating’s Long (<i>e</i>) tells:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At one of the landing places of the St. Peters river, in the Sioux country, we observed
a block of granite of about eighty pounds weight; it was painted red and
covered with a grass fillet, in which were placed twists of tobacco offered up in
sacrifice. Feathers were stuck in the ground all round the stone.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Eastman (<i>a</i>) also describes a stone painted red, which the Dakotas
called grandfather, in reverence, at or near which they placed as
offerings their most valuable articles. They also killed dogs and horses
before it as sacrifices.</p>

<p>In “A study of Pueblo Architecture,” by Victor Mindeleff, in the
Eighth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, is an account of
the cosmology of the Pueblos as symbolized in their architecture and
figured devices, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the beginning all men lived together in the lowest depths, in a region of darkness
and moisture; their bodies were misshapen and horrible and they suffered
great misery, moaning and bewailing continually. Through the intervention of
Myuingwa (a vague conception known as the god of the interior) and of Baholikonga
(a crested serpent of enormous size, the genius of water) “the old man” obtained a
seed from which sprang a magic growth of cane. It penetrated through a crevice in
the roof overhead and mankind climbed to a higher plane. A dim light appeared in
this stage and vegetation was produced. Another magic growth of cane afforded
the means of rising to a still higher plane, on which the light was brighter; vegetation
was reproduced and the animal kingdom was created. The final ascent to this
present or fourth plane was effected by similar magic growths and was led by
mythic twins, according to some of the myths, by climbing a great pine tree, in
others by climbing the cane, <i>Phragmites communis</i>, the alternate leaves of which
afforded steps as of a ladder, and in still others it is said to have been a rush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468">[468]</a></span>
through the interior of which the people passed up to the surface. The twins sang as
they pulled the people out, and when their song was ended no more were allowed to
come, and hence many more were left below than were permitted to come above;
but the outlet through which mankind came has never been closed, and Myuingwa
sends through it the germs of all living things. It is still symbolized by the peculiar
construction of the hatchway of the kiva and in the designs on the sand altars
in these underground chambers, by the unconnected circle painted on pottery, and
by devices on basketry and other textile fabrics.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">MYTHS AND MYTHIC ANIMALS.</span></h3>

<p>Among the hundreds of figures and characters seen by the present
writer on the slate rocks that abound on the shores and islands of Kejimkoojik
Lake, Queen’s county, Nova Scotia, described in Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>,
Sec. <a href="#page037">1</a>, there appears a class of incised figures illustrating the religious
myths and folk lore of the Indian tribes which inhabited the neighborhood
within historic times. It is probable that in other parts of America,
and, indeed, in all lands, the pictographic impulses and habits of the
people have induced them to represent the scenes and characters of
their myths on such rocks as were adapted to the purpose, as they are
known to have done on bark, skins, and other objects. But these exhibitions
of the favorite or prevalent myths in the shape of petroglyphs,
though doubtless existing, have seldom been understood and deciphered
by modern students. Sometimes they have not originally been sufficiently
distinct or have become indefinite by age, and frequently their
artists have been people of languages, religions, and customs different
from the tribes now or lately found in the localities and from whom the
significance of the petroglyphs has been sought in vain. The conditions
of the characters at Kejimkoojik, now mentioned, are perhaps
unique. They are drawn with great distinctness and sufficient skill, so
that when traced on the rocks they immediately struck the present
writer as illustrative of the myths and tales of the Abnaki. Many of
these myths had been recently repeated to him by Mrs. W. Wallace
Brown, of Calais, Maine, the highest authority in that line of study, and
by other persons visited in Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and in
Cape Breton and Prince Edwards Islands, who were familiar with the
Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Amalecite, and Micmac tribes. A number
of these myths and tales had before been collected in variant forms by
Mr. Charles G. Leland (<i>a</i>). It is a more important and convincing fact
that the printed impressions of the figures now presented were at once
recognized by individual Indians of the several Abnaki tribes above
mentioned to have the signification explained below. It is also to be
noted that these Abnaki have preserved the habit of making illustrations
from their stories by scratchings and scrapings on birch bark. The
writer saw several such figures on bark ornaments and utensils which
exhibited parts of the identical myths indicated in the petroglyphs but
not the precise scenes or characters depicted on the rocks. The selection<span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469">[469]</a></span>
of themes and their treatment were not conventional and showed some
originality and individuality both in design and execution. From the
appearance and surroundings of the rock drawings now specially under
discussion they were probably of considerable antiquity and suggested
that the Micmacs, who doubtless were the artists, had gained the idea of
practicing art for itself, not merely using the devices of pictography for
practical purposes, such as to record the past or to convey information.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 654.</span>&mdash;Myth of Pokinsquss.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 654 is one of the drawings mentioned, and indicates one episode
among the very numerous adventures of Glooscap, the Hero-God of the
Abnaki, several of which are connected with a powerful witch called by
Mr. Leland Pook-jin-skwess, or the Evil Pitcher, and by Mrs. W.
Wallace Brown, Pokinsquss, the Jug Woman. She is also called the
toad woman, from one of her transformations, and often appeared in a
male form to fight Glooscap after he had disdained her love proffered
as a female. Among the multitude of tales on this general theme, one
narrates how Glooscap was at one time a Pogumk, or the small animal
of the weasel family commonly called Fisher (Mustela Canadensis), also
translated as Black Cat, and was the son of the chief of a village of
Indians who were all Black Cats, his mother being a bear. Doubtless
these animal names and the attributes of the animals in the tales refer
to the origin of totemic divisions among the Abnaki. Pokinsquss was
also of the Black Cat village, and hated the chief and contrived long
how she could kill him and take his place. Now, one day when the
camp had packed up to travel, the witch asked the chief Pogumk to
go with her to gather gull’s eggs; and they went far away in a canoe
to an island where the gulls were breeding and landed there, and then
she hid herself to spy, and having found out that the Pogumk was
Glooscap, ran to the canoe and paddled away singing:</p>

<p>
Nikhed-ha Pogumk min nekuk,<br />
Netswil sāgāmawin!<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>Which being translated from the Passamaquoddy language <span class="lock">means&mdash;</span></p>

<p>
I have left the Black Cat on an island,<br />
I shall be chief of the Fishers now!<br />
</p>

<p>The continuation of the story is found in many variant shapes.
In one of them Glooscap’s friend the Fox came to his rescue, as
through Glooscap’s m’toulin or magic power he heard the song of
appeal though miles away beyond forests and mountains. In others the
Sea Serpent appears in answer to the Hero-God’s call, and the latter,
mounting the serpent’s back, takes a load of stones as his cargo to throw
at the serpent’s horns when the latter did not swim fast enough. In
the figure the island is shown at the lower right hand as a roundish
outline with Glooscap inside. The small round objects to the left are
probably the gull’s eggs, but may be the stimulating stones above mentioned.
Pokinsquss stands rejoicing in the stern of a canoe, which
points in the wavy water away from the island. The device to the
left of the witch may be the dismantled camp of the Black Cats, and
the one to her right is perhaps where the Fox “beyond forests and
mountains” heard Glooscap’s song of distress.</p>

<p>Fig. 655, another specimen of the same class, refers to one of the tales
about At-o-sis, the Snake, who was the lover of a beautiful Abnaki
woman. He appeared to her from out the surface of a lake as a young
hunter with a large shining silvery plate on his heart and covered with
brilliant white brooches as fish are covered with scales. He provided
her with all animals for food. The bow attached to the semi-human
head in the illustration may refer to this expertness in the chase. The
head of the female figure is covered or masked by one of the insignia of
rank and power mentioned in Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span>, Sec. <a href="#page388">2</a>. She became the

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 656.</span>&mdash;Myth of the Weasel girls.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 656, from the same locality, shows simply a crane, and a woman
who bears in her hand two branches; but this is a sufficient indication
of the tale of the Weasel girls, who had come
down from Star-land by means of a diminishing
hemlock tree, and flying from Lox had
come to a broad river which they could not
cross. But in the edge of the water stood
motionless a large crane, or the Tum-gwo-lig-unach,
who was the ferryman. “Now, truly,
this is esteemed to be the least beautiful of all
the birds, for which cause he is greedy of good words and fondest of
flattery. And of all beings there were none who had more bear’s oil
ready to annoint every one’s hair with&mdash;that is to say, more compliments
ready for everybody&mdash;than the Weasels. So, seeing the Crane,
they sang:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Wa wela quis kip pat kasqu',<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wa wela quis kip pat kasqu'.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Crane has a very beautiful long neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Crane has a very beautiful long neck.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>“This charmed the old ferryman very much, and when they said:
‘please, grandfather, hurry along,’ he came quickly. Seeing this, they
began to chant in chorus sweetly as the Seven Stars themselves:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Wa wela quig nat kasqu',<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wa wela quig nat kasqu'.
<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The crane has very beautiful long legs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">
The crane has very beautiful long legs.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>“Hearing this the good crane wanted more; so when they asked him
to give them a lift across he answered, slowly, that to do so he must be
well paid, but that good praise would answer as well. Now they who
had abundance of this and to spare for everybody were these very
girls. ‘Have I not a beautiful form?’ he inquired; and they both
cried aloud: ‘Oh, uncle, it is indeed beautiful!’ ‘And my feathers?’
‘Ah, <i>pegeakopchu</i>.’ ‘Beautiful and straight feathers, indeed!’ ‘And
have I not a charming long, straight, neck?’ ‘Truly our uncle has it
straight and long.’ ‘And will ye not acknowledge, oh maidens, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472">[472]</a></span>
my legs are fine?’ ‘Fine! oh, uncle, they are perfection. Never in this
life did we see such legs!’ So, being well pleased, the crane put them
across, and then the two little weasels scampered like mice into the
bush.”</p>

<p>Though but one woman figure is drawn, the two boughs borne by
her suggest the two weasel girls, who had come down the hemlock tree
and had also been water fairies until their garments were stolen by the
marten, and thereupon they had lost their fairy powers and become
women in a manner at once reminding of the Old World swan-maiden
myth.</p>

<p>Fig. 657 is a sketch of the Giant Bird Kaloo, or, in the literation of
Mr. Leland, Culloo. He was the most terrible of all creatures. He it
was who caught up the mischievous Lox in his claws and, mounting to
the top of the sky among the stars, let him drop, and he fell from dawn
to sunset. Lox was often a badger in the Micmac stories, and was more
Puck-like than the devilish character he showed among the Passamaquoddy,
being then generally in the form of a wolverine, though sometimes
in that of a lynx. In the illustration Kaloo is soaring among the
stars, and appears to possess an extra pair of legs armed with claws.
Perhaps one of the objects beneath his beak represents Lox or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473">[473]</a></span>
other victim falling through the air. There is another story of Lox’s
two feet talking and acting independently of the rest of his body, and
the two feet and legs without any body may be a symbol of the tricksy
demigod.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 659 is an exact copy of the design on a birch-bark jewel box
made by the Passamaquoddy of Maine, amiably contributed by Mrs.
W. W. Brown, together with the description of that part of the myth
which is illustrated on the box. There are several variants of this
myth, the nearest to the form now presented
being published by Mr. J. Walter
Fewkes (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>The Sable and the Black Cat wanted
some maple sugar, and went to a wood
where the maple trees grew. Toward night
they lost their way and separated from each
other to find it, agreeing to call to each
other by <i>m’toulin</i> power. These animals
were as frequently in human form as in
that designated by their names, and could
change to the forms of other animals. It
is not certain, from anything in the present
version of the myth, which one of the
daimons was represented by the Sable, but
the Black Cat afterward appears as Glooscap.
Sable, in his wanderings, came to a
wigwam in which was a large fire with a
kettle boiling over it, tended by a great
Snake. The Snake said he was glad the
Sable had come, as he was very hungry
and would eat him, but in gratitude for his
coming would put him to as little pain as
was possible. The Snake told him to go into the woods and get a straight
stick, so that when he pierced him he would not tear open his entrails.
Sable then went out and sang in a loud voice a <i>m’toulin</i> song for the
Black Cat to hear and come to his aid. The Black Cat heard him and
came to him. Then the Sable told the Black Cat how the Snake was
going to kill him. The Black Cat told Sable not to be afraid, but that
he would kill the big Snake. He told him that he would lie down
behind the trunk of a hemlock tree which had fallen and that Sable
should search out a stick that was very crooked, only pretending to
obey the commands of the great Snake. After finding such a stick he
should carry it to the Snake, who would complain that the stick was
not straight enough, and then Sable should reply that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474">[474]</a></span>
straighten it in the fire, holding it there until the steam came out of the
end. Then while the Snake watched the new mode of straightening
sticks Sable should strike the Snake over the eyes. The Sable sought
out the most crooked stick he could find and then returned to the wigwam
where the Snake was. The Snake said the stick was too crooked.
The Sable replied as directed and held it in the fire. When it was
burning he struck the Snake with it over the eyes, blinded him, and ran
away. The Snake followed the Sable, and as he passed over the hemlock
trunk the Black Cat killed him and they cut him into small pieces.</p>

<p>The two human figures on the left show the animals under the forest
trees in human form bidding good-bye before they parted in search of
the right trail. Their diminutive size gives the suggestion of distance
from the main scene. Next comes the great Snake’s wigwam, the stars
outside showing that night had come, and inside the kettle hung over
a fire, and on its right appear the wide-open jaws and an indication of
the head of the great Snake. The very crooked stick is on the other
side. Farther on the Black Cat comes responsive to the Sable’s call.
Next is shown, the Black Cat and the Sable, who is in human form,
near the hemlock tree. The fact that the tree is fallen is suggested,
without any attempt at perspective, by the broken-off branches and the
thick part of the trunk being upturned. The illustration ends with the
Black Cat sitting upon the Snake, clawing and throwing around pieces
of it.</p>

<p>The illustration above presented gives an excellent example of the
art of the Passamaquoddy in producing pictures by the simple scraping
of birch bark.</p>

<p>Mr. William H. Holmes, of the Bureau of Ethnology, gives the following
account (condensed from the American Anthropologist, July,
1890) of a West Virginia rock shelter (shown in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXI</span>). The copy
is in two rows of figures, but in the original there is only one row, the
parts marked <i>a</i> and <i>a</i> being united:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Harrison county, West Virginia, a small stream, Two-Lick creek, heading near
the Little Kanawha divide, descends into the west fork of the Monongahela about
4 miles west of Lost Creek station, on the Clarksburg and Weston railroad. Ascending
the stream for a little more than 2 miles and turning to the right up a tributary
called Campbells run, is a recess in the rocks, the result of local surface undermining
of an outcrop of sandstone assisted by roof degradation, which therefore is a
typical rock shelter. At the opening it is about 20 feet long and in the deepest part
extends back 16 feet.</p>

<p>The rock sculptures, of which simplified outlines are given in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXI</span>, occupy the
greater part of the back wall of the recess, covering a space of some 20 feet long by
about 4 feet in height. At the left the line of figures approaches the outer face of
the rock, but at the right it terminates in the depths of the chamber, beyond which
the space is too low and uneven to be utilized. There are indications that engravings
have existed above and below those shown, but their traces are too indistinct
to be followed.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY TENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XXXI<br />PICTOGRAPH IN ROCK SHELTER, WEST VIRGINIA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The more legible designs comprise three heads, resembling death’s-heads, one human
head or face, one obscure human figure, three birds resembling cranes or turkeys
(one with outspread wings), three mountain lions or beasts of like character, two
rattlesnakes, one turtle, one turtle-like figure with bird’s head, parts of several unidentified
creatures (one resembling a fish), and four conventional figures or devices
resembling, one a hand, one a star, one the track of a horse, and the fourth the track
of an elk, buffalo, deer, or domestic cow.</p>

<p>The serpents, placed above and toward the right of the picture, are much larger
than life, but the other subjects are represented somewhat nearly natural size. The
animal figure facing the two death’s-heads is drawn with considerable vigor and
very decidedly suggests the panther. A notable feature is the two back-curving
spines or spine-like tufts seen upon its shoulder; it is possible that these represent
some mythical character of the creature. Two of the animal figures, in accordance
with a widespread Indian practice, exhibit the heart and the life line, the latter
connecting the heart with the mouth; these features are, as usual, drawn in red.</p>

<p>The human head or face is somewhat larger than life; it is neatly hollowed out to
the nearly uniform depth of one-fourth of an inch, and is slightly polished over most
of the surface. Ear lobes are seen at the right and left, and an arched line, possibly
intended for a plume, rises from the left side of the head. A crescent-shaped band
of red extends across the face, and within this the eyes are indistinctly marked.
The mouth is encircled by a dark line and shows six teeth, the spaces between being
filled in with red.</p>

<p>Probably the most remarkable members of the series are the three death’s-heads
seen near the middle of the line. That they are intended to represent skulls and
not the living face or head is clear, and the treatment is decidedly suggestive of that
exhibited in similar work of the more cultured southern nations. The eye spaces
are large and deep, the cheek bones project, the nose is depressed, and the mouth is
a mere node depressed in the center.</p>

<p>All the figures are clearly and deeply engraved, and all save the serpents are in
full intaglio, being excavated over the entire space within the outlines and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page476" id="page476">[476]</a></span>
depth of from one-eighth to one-fourth of an inch. The serpents are outlined in
deep unsteady lines, ranging from one-fourth of an inch to 1 inch in width, and
in parts are as much as one-half an inch in depth. The example at the left is
rather carefully executed, but the other is very rude. It is proper to notice a wing-like
feature which forms a partial arch over the larger serpent. It consists of a
broad line of irregular pick marks, which are rather new looking and may not have
formed a part of the original design; aside from this, there are few indications of
the use of hard or sharp tools, and, although picking or striking must have been
resorted to in excavating the figures, the lines and surfaces were evidently finished
by rubbing. The friable character of the coarse, soft sandstone makes excavation
by rubbing quite easy, and at the same time renders it impossible to produce any
considerable degree of polish.</p>

<p>The red color used upon the large face and in delineating the life line and heart
of the animal figures is a red ocher or hematite, bits of which, exhibiting the effects
of rubbing, were found in the floor deposits of the recess. The exact manner of its
application is not known (perhaps the mere rubbing was sufficient), but the color is
so fixed that it can not be removed save by the removal of the rock surface.</p></div>

<p>Regarding the origin and purpose of these sculptures, it seems probable
that they are connected with religious practices and myths. If
the inscriptions were mnemonic records or notices it is reasonable to
suppose that they would have been placed so as to meet the eye of
others than those who made or were acquainted with them. But these
works are hidden in a mountain cave, and even yet, when the forest is
cleared and the surrounding slopes are cultivated, this secluded recess
is invisible from almost every side. The spot was evidently the resort
of a chosen few, such as a religious society. Such sequestered art
gives evidence of a mystic purpose.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It represents the orca or whale-killer, which the Haida believe to be a demon
called Skana. Judge Swan says that, according to their <span class="lock">belief&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“He can change into any desired form, and many are the legends about him. One
which was related to me was that ages ago the Indians were out seal-hunting. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478">[478]</a></span>
weather was calm and the sea smooth. One of these killers, or blackfish, a species
of porpoise, kept alongside of a canoe, and the young men amused themselves by
throwing stones from the canoe ballast and hitting the fin of the killer. After
some pretty hard blows from these rocks the creature made for the shore, where it
grounded on the beach. Soon a smoke was seen, and their curiosity prompted them
to ascertain the cause, but when they reached the shore they discovered, to their
surprise, that it was a large canoe, and not the Skana that was in the beach, and
that a man was on shore cooking some food. He asked them why they threw stones
at his canoe. ‘You have broken it,’ he said, ‘and now go into the woods and get
some cedar withes and mend it.’ They did so, and when they had finished the
man said, ‘Turn your backs to the water and cover your heads with your skin
blankets and don’t look till I call you.’ They did so, and heard the canoe grate on
the beach as it was hauled down to the surf. Then the man said, ‘Look, now.’ They
looked, but when it came to the second breaker it went under and presently came
up outside of the breaker a killer and not a canoe, and the man or demon was in its
belly. This allegory is common among all the tribes on the Northwest Coast, and
even with the interior tribes with whom the salmon takes the place of the orca,
which never ascends the fresh-water rivers. The Chilcat and other tribes of Alaska
carve figures of salmon, inside of which is the full length figure of a nude Indian.
* * * Casual observers without inquiry will at once pronounce it to be Jonah in
the fish’s belly, but the allegory is of ancient origin, far antedating the advent of the
white man or the teachings of the missionary.”</p></div>

<p>The same author, Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XLIX</span>, gives an explanation of Fig. 665, which

<p>The Haida version of the myth is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A number of Indian squaws were in the woods gathering berries when one of them,
the daughter of a chief, spoke in terms of ridicule of the whole bear species. The
bears descended on them and killed all but the chief’s daughter, whom the king of
the bears took to wife. She bore him a child half human and half bear. The carving
represents the agony of the mother in suckling this rough and uncouth offspring.
One day a party of Indian bear hunters discovered her up a tree and were about to
kill her, thinking her a bear, but she made them understand that she was human.
They took her home and she afterwards became the progenitor of all Indians belonging
to the bear totem. They believe that the bear are men transformed for the time
being. This carving was made by Skaows-ke'ay, a Haida. Cat. No. 73117, U. S. Nat.

whale. The legend says that he had stolen the son of the raven, who in order to
recover him, carried a whale out of a huge cedar that he covered with a coating of
gum. Then he let all kinds of animals go into the whale, and they went to the land
of the thunder-bird. When the bird saw the whale he sent out his youngest son to
catch it. He was unable to lift it. He stuck to the gum and the animals killed him.
In this way the whole family was slaughtered.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 670.</span>&mdash;Mythic wild-cats. Ojibway.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In a midē' song, given by James Tanner (<i>f</i>), is the representation
of an animal resembling the preceding, viz, the middle character of Fig.
670, to which is attached the Ojibway phrase and explanation as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Che-be-gau-ze-naung gwit-to-i-ah-na maun-dah-ween ah-kee-ge neen-wa-nah gua-kwaik
ke-nah gwit-to-i-ah-na.</p>

<p>I come to change the appearance of the ground, this ground; I make it look different
each season.</p>

<p>This is a Manito who, on account of his immensity of tail, and other peculiarities,
has no prototype. He claims to be the ruler over the seasons. He is probably
Gitche-a-nah-mi-e-be-zhew (great underground wild-cat).</p></div>

<p>The “underground wild-cat” is again mentioned in the same work,
page 377, with an illustration now presented as the left-hand character
of the same Fig. 670, slightly different from the above, described as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A-nah-me be-zhe ne-kau-naw.</p>

<p>Underground wild-cat is my friend.</p>

<p>At the fourth verse he exhibits his medicines, which he says are the roots of shrubs
and of We-ug-gusk-oan, or herbs, and from these he derives his power, at least in
part; but lest his claim, founded on a knowledge of these, should not be considered
of sufficient importance, he proceeds to say, in the fifth and sixth verses, that the
snakes and the underground wild-cat are among his helpers and friends. The ferocity
and cunning, as well as the activity of the feline animals have not escaped the notice
of the Indians, and very commonly they give the form of animals of this family to
those imaginary beings whose attributes bear, in their opinion, some resemblance to
the qualities of these animals. Most of them have heard of the lion, the largest of
the cats known to white men, and all have heard of the devil; they consider them
the same. The wild-cat here figured has horns, and his residence is under the
ground; but he has a master, Gitche-a-nah-mi-e-be-zhew (the great underground wild-cat),
who is, as some think, Matche-Manito himself, their evil spirit, or devil. Of
this last they speak but rarely.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id="page482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>In another song from Tanner, p. 345, sung only by the midē', is the
drawing, the right hand character of the same figure, of a similar animal
with a bar across the throat, signifying, no doubt, its emerging or
appearance from the surface of the ground.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nah-ne-bah o-sa ann neen-no ne-mah-che oos-sa ya-ah-ne-no. [Twice.]</p>

<p>I walk about in the nighttime.</p>

<p>This first figure represents the wild-cat, to whom, on account of his vigilance, the
medicines for the cure of diseases were committed. The meaning probably is that
to those who have the shrewdness, the watchfulness, and intelligence of the wild-cat,
is intrusted the knowledge of those powerful remedies, which, in the opinion of the
Indians, not only control life and avail to the restoration of health but give an
almost unlimited power over animals and birds.</p></div>

he asserts was taken from this animal. He considers it a potent medicine and uses
it by filing a small piece in water. He has also a small piece of native copper which

<h4>THUNDER BIRDS.</h4>

<p>Some forms of the thunder bird are here presented:</p>

<p>Figs. 673 and 674 are forms of the thunder
bird found in 1883 among the Dakotas
near Fort Snelling, drawn and interpreted
by themselves. They are both winged,
and have waving lines extending from the
mouth downward, signifying lightning. It
is noticeable that Fig. 673 placed vertically,
then appearing roughly as an upright
human figure, is almost identically the
same as some of the Ojibwa meda or spirit
figures represented in Schoolcraft, and
also on a bark Ojibwa record in the possession
of the writer.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 677.</span>&mdash;Dakota
thunder-bird.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Sioux believe that thunder is a large bird, and represent it thus,
Fig. 677, according to Mrs. Eastman (<i>c</i>), who adds details condensed
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This figure is often seen worked with porcupine quills on their ornaments. U-mi-ne
wah-chippe is a dance given by some one who fears thunder and thus endeavors
to propitiate the god and save his own life.</p>

<p>A ring is made of about 60 feet in circumference by sticking saplings
in the ground and bending their tops down, fastening them
together. In the center of this ring a pole is placed, about 15 feet in
height and painted red. From this swings a piece of birch bark cut
so as to represent thunder. At the foot of the pole stand two boys and two girls.
The boys represent war; they are painted red and hold war clubs in their hands.
The girls have their faces painted with blue clay; they represent peace.</p>

<p>On one side of the circle a kind of booth is erected, and about 20 feet from it a
wigwam. There are four entrances. When all arrangements for the dance are concluded
the man who gives it emerges from his wigwam, dressed up hideously, crawling
on all fours toward the booth. He must sing four tunes before reaching it.</p>

<p>In the meantime the medicine men, who are seated in the wigwam, beat time on
the drum, and the young men and squaws keep time to the music by hopping on one
foot and then on the other, moving around inside the ring as fast as they can. This
is continued for about five minutes, until the music stops. After resting a few
moments the second tune commences and lasts the same length of time, then the
third and the fourth; the Indian meanwhile making his way toward the booth. At
the end of each tune a whoop is raised by the men dancers.</p>

<p>After the Indian has reached his booth inside the ring he must sing four more
tunes. At the end of the fourth tune the squaws all run out of the ring as fast as
possible, and must leave by the same way that they entered, the other three entrances
being reserved for the men, who, carrying their war implements, might be accidentally
touched by one of the squaws, and the war implements of the Sioux warrior
have from time immemorial been held sacred from the touch of woman. For
the same reason the men form the inner ring in dancing round the pole, their war
implements being placed at the foot of the pole.</p>

<p>When the last tune is ended the young men shoot at the image of thunder, which is
hanging to the pole, and when it falls a general rush is made by the warriors to get
hold of it. There is placed at the foot of the pole a bowl of water colored with blue
clay. While the men are trying to seize the parts of the bark representation of their
god they at the same time are eagerly endeavoring to drink the water in the bowl,
every drop of which must be drank.</p>

<p>The warriors then seize on the two boys and girls (the representations of war and
peace) and use them as roughly as possible, taking their pipes and war-clubs from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page485" id="page485">[485]</a></span>
them and rolling them in the dirt until the paint is entirely rubbed off from their
faces. Much as they dislike this part of the dance, they submit to it through fear,
believing that after this performance the power of thunder is destroyed.</p></div>

<p>James’s Long (<i>f</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When a Kansas Indian is killed in battle the thunder is supposed to take him up
they do not know where. In going to battle each man traces an imaginary figure of
the thunder on the soil, and he who represents it incorrectly is killed by the thunder.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is at Eneti, on the reservation [Washington Territory], an irregular basaltic
rock, about 3 feet by 3 feet and 4 inches, and a foot and a half high. On one side
there has been hammered a face, said to be the representation of the face of the thunder-bird,
which could also cause storms.</p>

<p>The two eyes are about 6 inches in diameter and 4 inches apart and the nose about
9 inches long. It is said to have been made by some man a long time ago, who felt
very badly, and went and sat on the rock and with another stone hammered out the
eyes and nose. For a long time they believed that if the rock was shaken it would
cause rain, probably because the thunder-bird was angry.</p></div>

thunder-bird.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Marcano (<i>d</i>), describing Fig. 684, reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At Boca del Infierno (mouth of hell), on a plain, there are
found stones, separated from each other by spaces of 7 meters,
on which are found inscriptions nearly a centimeter in depth.
One of them represents a great bird similar to those which
the Oyampis (Crevaux) are in the habit of drawing. On its
left shoulder are seen three concentric circles arranged like
those that form the eyes of the jaguars of Calcara. This figure
is often reproduced in Venezuelan Guiana and beyond the Esequibo.
The bird is united at the right by a double connecting
stroke with another which is incomplete and much smaller.
Furthermore, three small circles are seen below the left wing;
three others, farther apart, separate its right wing from the
neck of the lower bird. The triangles which form the breast
and the tail of the two birds are worthy of note.</p></div>

<p>Mr. A. Ernst (<i>b</i>) describes the same figure:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the same place (“Boca del Infierno,” a rapid of the
Orinoco, 35 kilometers below the mouth of the Caura) is easily
recognized a rough representation of two birds; from the
feathers of the larger one water seems to be dropping; above,
to the right, is seen a picture of the sun. This may be symbolic,
and would then remind one of the representation of the
wind and rain gods on the ruins of Central America.</p></div>

objects are depicted by porcupine quills worked on pieces of birch bark,
and represent various forms of the

as having been obtained from a
northwestern tribe, which may safely be
designated as the Ojibwa, because the
figures relate to one of the most important
mythic animals of that tribe, and
also because birch bark is used, a material
exceedingly scarce in the country
of the Sioux, among whom also the
thunder-bird has a prominent religious
position.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is the “Rain bird” (Tci-zur), the upper portion surrounded by inclosing cloud
symbols, arranged so as to convey the idea of the germinative symbol
implying the generative power of rain. The crosshatching,
still water, in the wings denotes rain water in volume. The body
or tail of the bird divided into two tapering prolongations is a
very common occurrence. As a cloud emblem in the modern ware,
the Tci-zur is not like the Um-tokina (Thunder-bird) in mythical
creation, but is the comprehensive name used by the women for
any small bird. Explained as a rain emblem by the fact that during
seasons of sufficient rainfall flocks of small birds surround the
villages and gardens, while during drought they take flight to the
distant water courses.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Thomas Worsnop (<i>a</i>) gives an account of Fig. 689, abbreviated
as follows:</p>

<p>Sir George Grey, between 1836 and 1839, saw on a sandstone rock a
most extraordinary large figure. Upon examination this proved to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page490" id="page490">[490]</a></span>
a drawing at the entrance to a cave, which he found to contain besides
many remarkable paintings. On the sloping roof the principal character,
i. e., the upper one of Fig. 689, was drawn. In order to produce
the greater effect the rock about it was painted black and the figure
itself colored with the most vivid red and white. It thus appeared to
stand out from the rock, and Sir George Grey says he was surprised at the
moment that he first saw this gigantic head and upper part of a body
bending over and staring grimly down at him. He adds that it
would be impossible to convey in words an adequate idea of this
uncouth and savage figure, and therefore he only gives such a succinct
account as will serve as a sort of description.</p>

<p>Its head was encircled by bright red rays, something like the rays
one sees proceeding from the sun, when depicted on the signboard of a
public house; inside of this came a broad stripe of very brilliant red,
which was crossed by lines of white; but both inside and outside of
this red space were narrow stripes of a still deeper red, intended probably
to mark its boundaries; the face was painted vividly white and
the eyes black, being, however, surrounded by red and yellow lines;
the body, hands, and arms were outlined in red, the body being curiously
painted with red stripes and bars.</p>

<p>Upon the rock which formed the left-hand wall of this cave, and
which partly faced you on entering, was a very singular painting, the
lower character of the same figure, vividly colored, representing four
heads joined together. From the mild expression of the countenances
they appeared to represent females, and to be drawn in such a manner,
and in such a position, as to look up at the principal figure, before
described; each had a very remarkable head-dress, colored bright blue,
and one had a necklace on. Both of the lower figures had a sort of
dress painted with red in the same manner as that of the principal
figure, and one of them had a band round her waist. In Sir George
Grey’s opinion each of the four faces was marked by a totally distinct
expression of countenance, and none of them had mouths.</p>


<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">SHAMANISM.</span></h3>

<p>The term “shaman” is a corrupted form of the Sanscrit word meaning
ascetic. Its original application was to the religion of certain tribes
of northern Asia, but now shamanism is generally used to express
several forms of religion which are founded in the supposed communion
with and influence over supernatural beings by means of magic arts.
The shaman or priest pretends to control by incantations and ceremonies
the evil spirits to whom death, sickness, and other misfortunes are
ascribed. This form or stage of religion was so prevalent among the
North American Indians that the adoption of the term “shaman” here
is substantially correct, and it avoids both the stupid expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="page491" id="page491">[491]</a></span>
“medicine man” of current literature and the indefinite title “priest,”
the associations with which are not appropriate to the Indian religious
practitioner. The statement that the Indians worship, or ever have
worshiped, one “Great Spirit” or single overruling personal god is
erroneous. That philosophical conception is beyond the stage of culture
reached by them, and was not found in any tribe previous to missionary
influence. Their actual philosophy can be expressed far more objectively
and therefore pictorially.</p>

<p>The special feature of the notes now collected under the present heading
relates to the claims and practices of shamans, but the immediately
succeeding headings of “Charms and Amulets” and of “Religious
Ceremonies” are closely connected with the same topic. It must be
confessed that, as now presented, they have been arranged chiefly for
mechanical convenience, to which convenience also in other parts of the
present work scientific discrimination has sometimes been forced to
yield without, it is hoped, much injury. Individual intercomparison,
with or without cross references, is besought from any critical reader
of this paper.</p>

<p>Feats of jugglery or pretended magic rivaling or surpassing the best
of spiritualistic séances have been recounted to the present writer in
many places by independent and intelligent Indian witnesses, not
operators, generally of advanced age. The cumulated evidence gives
an opportunity for spiritualists to argue for the genuineness of their
own manifestations or manipulations as, in accordance with the degree
of credence, they may be styled. Others will contend that these remarkable
performances in which this hemisphere was rich before the Columbian
discovery&mdash;the occidental rivaling the oriental Indians&mdash;belong
to a culture stage below civilization. They will observe that the age
of miracles among barbaric people has not expired, and that it still
exists among outwardly civilized persons who are yet subject to superstition
in its true etymologic sense of “remaining over from the past.”</p>

<p>The most elaborate and interesting of these stories which are known
relate to a time about forty years ago, shortly before the Davenport
brothers and the Fox sisters had excited interest in the civilized portions
of the United States; but exhibitions of a magic character are
still given among the tribes, though secretly, from fear of the Indian
agents and missionaries. It is an important fact that the first French
missionaries in Canada and the early settlers of New England described
substantially the same performances when they first met the Indians,
all of whom belonged to the Algonquian or Iroquoian stocks. So
remarkable and frequent were these performances of jugglery that the
French, in 1613, called the whole body of Indians on the Ottawa River,
whom they met at a very early period, “The Sorcerers.” They were the
tribes afterwards called Nipissing, and were the typical Algonquians.
No suspicion of prestidigitation or other form of charlatanry appears
to have been entertained by any of the earliest French and English<span class="pagenum"><a name="page492" id="page492">[492]</a></span>
writers on the subject. The severe Puritan and the ardent Catholic
both considered that the exhibitions were real, and the work of Satan.
It is also worth mentioning that one of the derivations of the name
“Micmac” is connected with the word meaning sorcerer. The early
known practices of this character, which had an important effect upon
the life of the people, extended from the extreme east of the continent
to the Great Lakes. They have been found later far to the south, and
in a higher state of evolution.</p>

<p>It was obvious in cross-examining the old men of the Algonquians that
the performances of jugglery were exhibitions of the pretended miraculous
power of an adventurer whereby he obtained a reputation above
his rivals and derived subsistence and authority by the selling of
charms and pretended superhuman information. The charms and
fetiches which still are bought from the few shamans who yet have
a credulous clientele are of three kinds&mdash;to bring death or disease
on an enemy, to lure an enemy into an ambush, and to excite a return
to sexual love.</p>

<p>Among the Ojibwa three distinct secret societies are extant, the members
of which are termed, respectively and in order of their importance,
the Midē', the Jĕs'sakīd, and the Wâbĕnō. The oldest and most influential
society is known as the Midē'wiwin', or Grand Medicine, and the
structure in which the ceremonies are conducted is called the Midē'wigân,
or Grand Medicine lodge.</p>

<p>The following statement of the White Earth Midē' shaman presents
his views upon the origin of the rite and the objects employed in connection
with ceremonies, as well as in the practices connected with
medical magic and sorcery:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Minabō'sho, the first man, had been for some time upon the earth, two great
spirits told him that to be of service to his successors they would give to him several
gifts, which he was to employ in prolonging life and extending assistance to
those who might apply for it.</p>

<p>The first present consisted of a sacred drum, which was to be used at the side of
the sick and when invoking the presence and assistance of the spirits. The second
was a sacred rattle, with which he was enabled to prolong the life of a patient. The
third gift was tobacco, which was to be an emblem of peace; and as a companion he
also received a dog. He was then told to build a lodge, where he was to practice
the rites of which he would receive further instruction.</p>

<p>All the knowledge which the Midē' have, and more, Minabō'sho received from the
spirits. Then he built a long lodge, as he had been directed, and now even at this
day he is present at the Sacred Medicine lodge when the Grand Medicine rite is performed.</p>

<p>In the rite is incorporated most that is ancient amongst them, songs and traditions
that have descended, not orally alone, but by pictographs, for a long line of generations.
In this rite is also perpetuated the purest and most ancient idioms of their
language, which differs somewhat from that of the common, every-day use.</p></div>

<p>It is desirable to explain the mode of using the Midē' and other bark
records of the Ojibwa and also those of other tribes mentioned in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id="page493">[493]</a></span>
paper. A comparison made by Dr. Tyler of the pictorial alphabet to
teach children, “A was an archer,” etc., is not strictly appropriate in
this case. The devices are not only mnemonic, but are also ideographic
and descriptive. They are not merely invented to express or memorize
the subject, but are evolved therefrom. To persons acquainted with
secret societies a good comparison for the charts or rolls is what is
called the trestle board of the Masonic order, which is printed and published
and publicly exposed without exhibiting any of the secrets of the
order, yet through its ideography it is practically useful to the esoteric
members by assisting memory in details of ceremony and it also prevents
deviation from the established ritual.</p>

Niwi'kki, curing a sick woman by sucking the demon

<p>When the method of procedure of a Midē' goes beyond
the ordinary ceremonies, such as chanting prayers and
drumming, the use of the rattle, and the administration
of magic medicines and exorcisms, it overlaps the prescribed
formulæ of the Midē'win and partakes of the
rites of the Jĕssakkī'd or “Juggler.”</p>

<p>The following group, including Figs. 693 to 697, gives several modes
of illustrating the “making buffalo medicine” by the Dakotas and other
tribes of the Great Plains. The main object was to bring the buffalo to
where they could be hunted successfully, and incantations, with dancing
and many ceremonies, were resorted to, as upon the buffalo the tribes depended
not only for food but for most of the necessaries and conveniences
of their daily life. The topic is referred to elsewhere in this
paper, especially in Lone-Dog’s Winter Count for the year 1810-’11.</p>

of this class bore reference to some herb or form of treatment, each of
which was represented objectively or pictorially and produced simultaneously

pleasure or relief afforded to the patient by the respective songs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was thought necessary to have recourse to a medicine hunt. Nah-gitch-e-gum-me
[a “medicine” maker] sent to me and O-ge-mah-we-ninne, the best two
hunters of the band, each a little leather sack of medicine, consisting of certain
roots pounded fine and mixed with red paint, to be applied to the little images or
figures of the animals we wish to kill. Precisely the same method is practiced in
this kind of hunting, at least as far as the use of medicine is concerned, as in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id="page496">[496]</a></span>
instances where one Indian attempts to inflict disease or suffering on another. A
drawing or a little image is made to represent the man, the woman, or the animal on
which the power of the medicine is to be tried; then the part representing the heart
is punctured with a sharp instrument, if the design be to cause death, and a little
of the medicine is applied. The drawing or image of an animal used in this case is
called muzzin-ne-neen, and the same name is applicable to the little figures of a man
or women, and is sometime rudely traced on birch bark, in other instances more carefully
carved of wood. These little images or drawings, for they are called by the
same names, whether of carved wood or rags or only rudely sketched on birch
bark, or even traced in sand, are much in use among several and probably all the
Algonquin tribes. Their use is not confined to hunting, but extends to the making
of love, and the gratification of hatred, revenge, and all malignant passions.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 701.</span>&mdash;Muzzin-ne-neen. Ojibwa.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is a prevailing belief that the necromancers, men or women of medicine, or
those who are acquainted with the hidden powers of their <i>wusks</i>, can, by practicing
upon the muzzin-ne-neence, exercise an unlimited control over the body and mind
of the person represented. Many a simple Indian girl gives to some crafty old squaw
her most valued ornaments, or whatever property she may possess, to purchase from
her the love of the man she is most anxious to please. The old woman, in a case of
this kind, commonly makes up a little image of stained wood and rags, to which she
gives the name of the person whose inclinations she is expected to control; and to
the heart, the eyes, or to some other part of this she, from time to time, applies her
medicines, or professes to have done so, as she may find necessary to dupe and encourage
her credulous employer.</p>

<p>But the influence of these images and conjurations is more frequently tested in
cases of an opposite character, where the inciting cause is not love, but hatred, and
the object to be attained the gratification of a deadly revenge. In cases of this kind
the practices are similar to those above mentioned, only different medicines are used
Sometimes the muzzin-ne-neence is pricked with a pin or needle in various parts,
and pain or disease is supposed to be produced in the corresponding part of the person
practiced upon. Sometimes they blacken the hands and mouth of the image,
and the effect expected is the change which marks the near approach of death.</p></div>

<p>The similarity, approaching identity, of these practices to those common
in Europe during the middle ages and continuing in some regions
until the present time will be noticed.</p>

<p>The rod of the bow upon which the characters occur is here represented
in three sections, A, B, and C. A bears the beginning of the

<i>c</i>, tree; <i>d</i>, winter habitations; <i>e</i>, storehouse; <i>f</i>, tree. Between this and
the storehouse is placed a piece of timber, from which is suspended fish
for drying. <i>g</i>, storehouse. The characters from <i>a</i> to <i>g</i> represent a
group of dwellings, which signifies a settlement, the home of the
person to whom the history relates. <i>h</i>, the hunter sitting on the
ground, asking for aid, and making the gesture for supplication. <i>i</i>, the
shaman to whom application is made by the hunter desiring success in
the chase. The shaman has just finished his incantations, and while
still retaining his left arm in the position for that ceremony, holds the
right toward the hunter, giving him the success requested. <i>j</i>, the shaman’s
winter lodge; <i>k</i>, trees; <i>l</i>, summer habitation of the shaman;
<i>m</i>, trees near the shaman’s home.</p>

<p>B. <i>n</i>, tree; <i>o</i>, a shaman standing upon his lodge, driving back
game which had approached against his wish. To this shaman the
hunter had also made application for success in the chase, but was
denied, hence the act of driving back. <i>p</i>, deer leaving at the shaman’s
order; <i>q</i>, horns of a deer swimming a river; <i>r</i>, young deer, apparently,
from the smaller size of the body and unusually long legs.</p>

<p>C. <i>s</i>, a tree; <i>t</i>, the lodge of the hunter (A. <i>h</i>), who, after having
been granted the request for success, placed his totem upon the lodge
as a mark of gratification and to insure greater luck in his undertaking;
<i>u</i>, the hunter in the act of shooting; <i>v-w</i>, the game killed,
consisting of five deer; <i>x</i>, the demon sent out by the shaman (A. <i>i</i>), to
drive the game in the way of the hunter; <i>y-bb</i>, the demon’s assistants.</p>

<p>Your figure of a shaman’s lodge in Alaska [Fig. <a href="#page507">714</a> in this work] reminds me of a
drawing made of the same character on this reservation by one of our best educated
Indian boys. His description of it is as follows: “When I was at Dr. Charley’s
house (the shaman or medicine man), they tamahnoused [performed incantations] over
[my brother] Frank. They saw that he was under a kind of sickness. Dr. Charley
took it, and just a little after that Frank shook and became stiff, and while I sat I
heard my father say that his breath was gone. I went out, as I did not want to see
my brother lay dead before me. When I came back he was breathing a little and
his eyes were closed. Dr. Charley was taking care of his breath with his own
tamahnous [guardian spirit] and waiting for more folks to come, so as to have
enough folks to beat on sticks when he should tamahnous and see what was the
matter with Frank. So he went on and saw that there was another kind of sickness
besides the one he took first. The other one went over Frank and almost killed him.
Dr. Charley took it again and went (travel) [in spirit] with another kind of tamahnous
to see where Frank’s spirit was. He found him at Humahuma [18 or 20 miles
distant], where they had camped [some time previous]. So Frank got better after
a hard tamahnous. From the drawing you will see how Dr. Charley fixed the kind
of sickness. <i>b</i> shows the first sickness which Dr. Charley took. It has tails,
which, when they come close to the sick person, makes him worse. <i>a</i> is the way it
goes when it kills a person and stays in his home. <i>c</i> is the second one and is hanging
over Frank, <i>d</i>. <i>e</i> is another sickness which is in Frank.”</p></div>

<p>In Kingsborough (<i>d</i>) is the following: “In the year of Eleven Houses,
or in 1529, Nuño de Guzman set out for Yalisco on his march to subdue
that territory. They pretend that a serpent descended from the sky,
exclaiming that troubles were preparing for the natives, since the
Christians were directing their course hither.” The illustration for this

<h3>SECTION 4.<br />

<span class="subhead">CHARMS AND AMULETS.</span></h3>

<p>The use of material objects for the magic purposes suggested by this
title is well known. Their graphic representation is not so familiar,
though it is to be supposed that the objects of this character would be
pictorially represented in pictographs connected with religion. The
following is an instance where the
use of a charm or fetich in action
was certainly portrayed in a pictograph.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 706, drawn by the Dakota Indians,
near Fort Snelling, Minnesota,
exhibits the use as a charm or
talisman of an instrument fashioned
in imitation of a war club, though
it is not adapted to offensive employment.
The head of the talisman
is a grooved stone hammer from
an inch and a half to 5 inches in
length. A withe is tied about the
middle of the hammer, in the groove
binding on a handle of from 2 to 4
feet in length. The latter is frequently
wrapped with buckskin or
rawhide to strengthen it, as well as
for ornamental purposes. Feathers
attached bear designs indicating
marks of distinction, perhaps sometimes
fetichistic devices not understood.</p>

<p>It is believed that these objects
possess the charm of warding off an
enemy’s missiles when held upright
before the body, as shown in the
pictograph. The interpretation was
explained by the draftsman himself.</p>

</div>

<p>“Medicine bags,” as they are
termed by frontiersmen, are worn
as amulets. They are sometimes filled by the owner in obedience to the
suggestions of visions, but more frequently are prepared by the shaman.
They are carried suspended from the neck by means of string or buckskin
cords, as shown in Fig. 707, drawn in 1889 by I-teup'-de-tĭ, No-Shin-Bone,
a Crow Indian, to represent himself with his insignia, and
was extracted from a record kindly communicated by Dr. R. B. Holden,
physician at the Crow Agency, Montana.</p>

<p>Fig. 708, drawn by the same hand, shows
the same medicine bag temporarily hung on a
forked stick. When the bag is carried on a
war party it is never allowed to touch the
ground. Also among the Ojibwa some of the
bags which are considered to have the greatest
fetichistic power are not kept in the lodges,
as too dangerous, but are suspended from
trees.</p>

<p>Capt. Bourke (<i>d</i>) gives the following account of the medicine hat of
the Apache:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The medicine hat of the old and blind Apache medicine man, Nan-ta-do-tash, was
an antique affair of buckskin, much begrimed with soot and soiled by long use.
Nevertheless it gave life and strength to him who wore it, enabled the owner to peer
into the future, to tell who had stolen ponies from other people, to foresee the approach
of an enemy, and to aid in the cure of the sick. * * * This same old man
gave me an explanation of all the symbolism depicted upon the hat, and a great
deal of valuable information in regard to the profession of medicine men, their
specialization, the prayers they recited, etc. The material of the hat, as already
stated, was buckskin. How that was obtained I can not assert positively, but from
an incident occurring under my personal observation in the Sierra Madre, in Mexico,
in 1883, where our Indian scouts and the medicine men with them surrounded a
nearly grown fawn and tried to capture it alive, as well as from other circumstances
too long to be here inserted, I am of the opinion that the buckskin to be used for
sacred purposes among the Apache must, whenever possible, be that of a strangled
animal, as is the case, according to Dr. Matthews, among the Navajo.</p>

<p>The body of Nan-ta-do-tash’s cap was unpainted, but the figures upon it were in
two colors, a brownish yellow and an earthy blue, resembling a dirty Prussian blue.
The ornamentation was of the downy feathers and black-tipped plumes of the eagle,
pieces of abalone shell and chalchihuitl, and a snake’s rattle on the apex.</p>

<p>Nan-ta-do-tash explained that the characters on the medicine hat meant: A, clouds;
B, rainbow; C, hail; E, morning star; F, the god of wind, with his lungs; G, the
black “kan;” H, the great stars or suns. “Kan” is the name given to their principal
gods. The appearance of the kan himself and of the tail of the hat suggest
the centipede, an important animal god of the Apache. The old man said that the
figures represented the powers to which he appealed for aid in his “medicine” and
the kan upon whom he called for help.</p></div>

<p>The same author says, op. cit., p. 587:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Apache, both men and women, wear amulets, called tzidaltai, made of lightning-riven
wood, generally pine or cedar or fir from the mountain tops, which are
highly valued and are not to be sold. These are shaved very thin and rudely cut in
the semblance of the human form. They are in fact the duplicates, on a small scale,
of the rhombus. Like it they are decorated with incised lines representing the
lightning. Very often these are to be found attached to the necks of children or to
their cradles.</p></div>

<p>Four of the several winter counts described in the present work unite
in specifying for the year 1843-’44 the recapture of a fetich called the
great medicine arrow.</p>

The Dakotas captured it this winter from the Pawnees, and
the Cheyennes then redeemed it for one hundred horses.”
His sign for the year is shown in Fig. 710. An attempt
was made to distinguish colors by the heraldic scheme,
which in this cut did not succeed. The upper part of the
man’s body is sable or black, the feathers on the arrow are
azure or blue, and the shaft, gules or red. The remainder
of the figure is of an undecided color not requiring specification.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY TENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XXXIII<br />MANTLE OF INVISIBILITY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXIII</span> is a copy of a cloak or mantle made from the skin of a
deer, and covered with various mystic paintings. It was made and
used by the Apaches as a mantle of invisibility, that is, a charmed
covering for spies which would enable them to pass with impunity
through the country, and even through the camp of their enemies. In
this instance the fetichistic power depends upon the devices drawn.
A similar but not identical pictographic fetich or charm is described
and illustrated by Capt. Bourke (<i>e</i>) as obtained from a Chicarahua
Apache which told when his ponies were lost, and which brought rain.
The symbols show, inter alia, the rain cloud, and the serpent lightning,
the raindrops and the cross of the winds of the four cardinal points.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id="page504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>Lewis and Clarke (<i>b</i>) say that the Chilluckittequaw, a Chinook tribe,
had a “medicine” bag colored red 2 feet long, suspended in the middle
of the lodge. It was held sacred, containing pounded dirt, roots, and
such mysterious objects. From the chief’s bag he brought out fourteen
forefingers of enemies&mdash;Snakes&mdash;whom he had killed.</p>

<p>A remarkable drawing in an Australian cave, described by Sir George
Grey, in Worsnop, op. cit., was an ellipse, 3 feet in length and 1 foot
10 inches in breadth. The outside line of the painting was of deep
blue color, the body of the ellipse being of a bright yellow dotted over
with red lines and spots, whilst across it ran two transverse lines of
blue. The portion of the painting above described formed the ground,
or main part of the picture, and upon this ground was painted a kangaroo
in the act of feeding; two stone spear heads, and two black
balls; one of the spear heads was flying to the kangaroo, and one away
from it; so that the whole subject probably constituted a sort of charm
by which the luck of an inquirer in killing game can be ascertained.

</div>

<p>George Turner (<i>c</i>) gives account of hieroglyphic taboos, as he calls
them, which are connected with the present subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sea-pike taboo. If a man wished that a sea-pike might run into the body of
the person who attempted to steal, say, his bread fruits, he would plait some cocoanut
leaflets in the form of a sea-pike, and suspend it from one or more of the trees
which he wished to protect.</p>

<p>The white-shark taboo was another object of terror to a thief. This was done by
plaiting a cocoanut leaf in the form of a shark, adding fins, etc., and this they
suspended from the tree. It was tantamount to an expressed imprecation, that the
thief might be devoured by the white shark the next time he went to fish.</p>

<p>The cross-stick taboo. This was a piece of any sort of stick suspended horizontally<span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id="page505">[505]</a></span>
from the tree. It expressed the wish of the owner of the tree, that any thief touching
it might have a disease running right across his body, and remaining fixed there
till he died.</p>

<p>The ulcer taboo. This was made by burying in the ground some pieces of clam
shell, and erecting at the spot three or four reeds, tied together at the top in a bunch
like the head of a man. This was to express the wish and prayer of the owner that
any thief might be laid down with ulcerous sores all over his body.</p>

<p>The death taboo. This was made by pouring some oil into a small calabash, and
burying it near the tree. The spot was marked by a little hillock of white sand.</p>

<p>The thunder taboo. If a man wished that lightning might strike any who should
steal from his land, he would plait some cocoanut leaflets in the form of a small
square mat, and suspend it from a tree, with the addition of some white streamers
of native cloth flying. A thief believed that if he trespassed, he, or some of his
children, would be struck with lightning, or perhaps his own trees struck and
blasted from the same cause. They were not, however, in the habit of talking
about the effects of lightning. It was the thunder they thought did the mischief;
hence they called that to which I have just referred the thunder taboo.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES.</span></h3>

<p>Many examples of masks, dance ornaments, and fetiches used in
ceremonies are reported and illustrated in the several papers of Messrs.
Cushing, Holmes, and Stevenson in the Second Annual Report of the
Bureau of Ethnology. Paintings or drawings of many of them have
been found on pottery, on shells, and on rocks.</p>

Moki, Zuñi, and Rio Grande Pueblos.</p>

<p>Dr. W. H. Corbusier, U. S. Army, writing from Camp Verde, Arizona,
kindly furnished the following account of Yuman ceremonies, in which
the making of sand pictures was prominent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All the medicine men meet occasionally and with considerable ceremony “make
medicine.” They went through the performance early in the summer of 1874 on the
reservation for the purpose of averting the diseases with which the Indians were
afflicted the summer previous. In the middle of one of the villages they made a
round ramada, or house of boughs, some 10 feet in diameter, and under it, on the
sand, illustrated the spirit land in a picture about 7 feet across, made in colors by
sprinkling powdered leaves and grass, red clay, charcoal, and ashes on the smoothed
sand. In the center was a round spot of red clay about 10 inches in diameter, and
around it several successive rings of green and red alternately, each ring being an
inch and a half wide. Projecting from the outer ring were four somewhat triangular-shaped
figures, each one of which corresponded to one of the cardinal points of the
compass, giving the whole the appearance of a Maltese cross. Around this cross and
between its arms were the figures of men with their feet toward the center, some
made of charcoal, with ashes for eyes and hair, others of red clay and ashes, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page506" id="page506">[506]</a></span>
These figures were 8 or 9 inches long, and nearly all of them lacked some portion of
the body, some an arm, others a leg or the head. The medicine men seated themselves
around the picture on the ground in a circle, and the Indians from the different
bands crowded around them, the old men squatting close by and the young men
standing back of them. After they had invoked the aid of the spirits in a number
of chants, one of their number, apparently the oldest, a toothless, gray-haired man,
solemnly arose and, carefully stepping between the figures of the men, dropped on
each one a pinch of the yellow powder which he took from a small buckskin bag which
had been handed to him. He put the powder on the heads of some, on the chests of
others, and on other parts of the body, one of the other men sometimes telling him
where to put it. After going all around, skipping three figures, however, he put up
the bag, and then went around again and took from each figure a large pinch of
powder, taking up the yellow powder also, and in this way collected a heaping
handful. After doing this he stepped back and another medicine man collected a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id="page507">[507]</a></span>
handful in the same way, others following him. Some of the laymen, in their eagerness
to get some, pressed forward, but were ordered back. But after the medicine
men had supplied themselves the ramada was torn down and a rush was made by
men and boys; handfuls of the dirt were grabbed and rubbed on their bodies or
carried away. The women and children, who were waiting for an invitation, were
then called. They rushed to the spot in a crowd, and grabbing handfuls of dirt
tossed it up in the air so that it would fall on them, or they rubbed their bodies with
it, mothers throwing it over their children and rubbing it on their heads. This
ended the performance.</p></div>

<p>According to Stephen Powers (in Contrib. to N. A. Ethnol., <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span>, p. 140),
there is at the head of Potter valley, California, “a singular knoll of red
earth which the Tatu or Hūchnom believe to have furnished the material
for the erection of the original coyote-man. They mix this red
earth into their acorn bread, and employ it for painting their bodies
on divers mystic occasions.”</p>

<p>Descriptions of ceremonies in medicine lodges and in the initiation
of candidates to secret associations have been published with and without
illustrations. The most striking of these are graphic ceremonial
charts made by the Indians themselves, a number of which besides those
immediately following appear in different parts of the present work.</p>

Ojibwa, who speak English, translate as “grand medicine,” were
performed twice a year&mdash;in the fall and in the spring. Those in the
spring were of a rejoicing character, to welcome the return of the good
spirits; those in the fall were in lamentation for the departure of the
beneficent and the arrival of the maleficent spirits. The drums were
beaten four days and nights before the dance, which lasted for a whole
day. After the dance twelve selected persons built a lodge, about the
center of which they placed stones which had been heated, and dancing
went on around it until the stones were moistened and cooled by the
sweat of the performers. Singing, or more properly chanting, regulated
the rhythm of the dances, although, perhaps, in the order of
evolution the dance was prior to the chant. These ceremonies were
performed by the body of the people, and were independent of the
initiations in the secret order. With regard to the candidates who
passed the initiations, it was mentioned as an undisputed fact that they
always became stronger and better men, perhaps because only those
succeeded who had the requisite strength of mind and body to endure
the various ordeals and to pass examination in the mysteries. In
pictography the spring and the fall, the drums and the steaming stones,
the dancing forms and the open chanting mouth are shown.</p>

<p>Catlin (<i>a</i>) gives an account of Kee-an-ne-kuk, the foremost man, who,
though a Kickapoo, was commonly called the Shawnee Prophet, and
also the following description relating to Fig. 715, painted by that
author in 1831:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ah-tón-we-tuck, The-Cock-Turkey, is another Kickapoo of some distinction and a
disciple of the [Shawnee] Prophet, in the attitude of prayer, which he is reading off
from characters cut upon a stick that he holds in his hand. It was told to me in
the tribe by the traders (though I am afraid to vouch for the whole truth of it) that
while a Methodist preacher was soliciting him for permission to preach in his village,
the Prophet refused him the privilege, but secretly took him aside and supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509">[509]</a></span>
him until he learned from him his creed and his system of teaching it to
others, when he discharged him and commenced preaching amongst his people himself,
pretending to have had an interview with some superhuman mission or inspired
personage, ingeniously resolving that if there was any honor or emolument or influence
to be gained by the promulgation of it, he might as well have it as another
person; and with this view he commenced preaching and instituted a prayer, which
he ingeniously carved on a maple stick of an inch and a half in breadth, in characters
somewhat resembling Chinese letters. These sticks, with the prayers on them,
he has introduced into every family of the tribe and into the hands of every individual;
and as he has necessarily the manufacturing of them all, he sells them at his
own price and has thus added lucre to fame, and in two essential and effective
ways augmented his influence in his tribe. Every man, woman, and child in the
tribe, so far as I saw them, were in the habit of saying their prayer from this stick
when going to bed at night and also when rising in the morning, which was invariably
done by placing the forefinger of the right hand under the upper character
until they repeat a sentence or two, which it suggests to them, and then slipping it
under the next and the next, and so on to the bottom of the stick, which altogether
required about ten minutes, as it was sung over in a sort of a chant to the end.</p></div>

which is described above. The ground plan indicated in this figure
seems to be divided by partitions, which, together with the human
figures and designs, probably refer to the rites of initiation and celebration
performed in them. Some of the Micmacs examined had a vague
recollection of these ceremonies, which, at the time of the European discovery
of the northeastern part of North America, probably were as
widely prevalent, as they continued to be much later, among the
regions farther in the interior, also occupied by the Algonquian tribes.</p>

<p>Fig. 718, from the same locality, is a
drawing of the ground plan of another
description of ceremonial wigwam or lodge
which is remarkably similar to that now
called by the Ojibwa “the jessăkân.” Its
distinguishing feature is the branch of a
tree erected on the outside, and it is the
wigwam of a juggler or wizard, and not the
lodge belonging to the regular order of the
Midē'. Such wigwams of jugglers, who
performed wonderful feats similar to those
of modern spiritualistic exhibitions, are
frequently mentioned by the early French
and English writers, who gave accounts
of the provinces of New France and New
England. The figure now presented is not suggestive without comparison,
and would not have been selected for the foregoing description<span class="pagenum"><a name="page511" id="page511">[511]</a></span>

whom it was significant.</p>

<p>Figs. 717 and 718, however, when studied, recall the use of branches
and prayer plumes in the descriptions of the houses, and especially
of the kivas of the Pueblos and the forms of their consecration mentioned
in the study of the Pueblo Architecture, by Mr. Victor Mindeleff,
in the Eighth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is difficult to elicit intelligent explanation of the theory of the baho and the
prayer ceremonies in either kiva or house construction. The baho is a prayer token;
the petitioner is not satisfied by merely speaking or singing his prayer; he must
have some tangible thing upon which to transmit it. He regards his prayer as a
mysterious, impalpable portion of his own substance, and hence he seeks to embody
it in some object which thus becomes consecrated. The baho, which is inserted in
the roof of the kiva, is a piece of willow twig about 6 inches long, stripped of its
bark and painted. From it hang four small feathers suspended by short cotton
strings tied at equal distances along the twig. In order to obtain recognition from
the powers especially addressed, different colored feathers and distinct methods of
attaching them to bits of wood and string are resorted to.</p></div>

<p>The characters in Fig. 719 are copied from a drawing on the rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="page512" id="page512">[512]</a></span>
in the Canyon Segy. They have been submitted to the most intelligent
of the old Moki priests, and are said to represent the primitive sun
priests. They watched for the sunrise every morning and the chief
sun priest kept a reckoning of the equinoxes. The chief sun priest, <i>a</i>,
made the daily sacrifices to the sun by scattering consecrated meal
and singing a prayer to the sun just as it rose. His assistant, <i>b</i>, lit a
pipe of tobacco at the same time, and exhaled puffs of smoke, one
toward each of the cardinal points, one to the zenith, and one to the
nadir. The three other figures are flageolet priests, and the skins of
different kinds of foxes were attached to their reed flageolets. <i>c</i> played
to the morning star, typified by the skin of the gray fox. <i>d</i> played to
the dawn, typified by the skin of the red fox. <i>e</i> played to the daylight,
typified by the skin of the yellow fox.</p>

<p>Dr. Franz Boas (<i>e</i>) reported as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Tsimshian have four secret societies, which have evidently been borrowed
from the Kwākiutl, the Olala or Wihalait, Nō'ntlem, Mē'itla, and Semhalait.</p>

<p>The candidate is taken to the house of his parents and a bunch of cedar bark is
fastened over the door, to show that the place is tabooed, and nobody is allowed to
enter. The chief sings while it is being fastened. In the afternoon the sacred house
is prepared for the dance. A section in the rear of the house is divided off by means
of curtains; it is to serve as a stage, on which the dancers and the novice appear.
When all is ready messengers carrying large carved batons are sent around to invite
the members of the society, the chief first. The women sit down in one row, nicely
dressed up in button blankets and their faces painted red. The chief wears the
amhalait, a carving rising from the forehead, set with sea-lion barbs and with a
long drapery of ermine skins; the others, the cedar bark rings of the society. * * *</p>

<p>The Mēitla have a red head ring and red eagle downs, the Nōntlem a neck ring
plaited of white and red cedar bark, the Olala a similar but far larger one. The
members of the societies receive a head ring for each time they pass through these
ceremonies. These are fastened one on top of the other.</p></div>

<p>Mr. James W. Lynd (<i>d</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the worship of their deities paint (with the Dakotas), forms an important
feature. Scarlet or red is the religious color for sacrifices, whilst blue is used by
the women in many of the ceremonies in which they participate. This, however, is
not a constant distinction of sex, for the women frequently use red and scarlet.
The use of paints, the Dakotas aver, was taught them by the gods. Unktehi taught
the first medicine men how to paint themselves when they worshiped him and what
colors to use. Takushkanshkan (the moving god), whispers to his favorites what
colors are most acceptable to him. Heyoka hovers over them in dreams, and informs
them how many streaks to employ upon their bodies and the tinge they must have.
No ceremony of worship is complete without the wakan or sacred application of
paint. The down of the female swan is colored scarlet and forms a necessary part
of sacrifices.</p></div>

<p>The paintings on this vase, found by Dr. Macedo in the excavations at Pachacamac,
show the principal practices of the exoteric worship of the sun. In this painting there
are three entirely distinct groups. The central one is composed of the solar image
surrounded by nine rays, terminating in symbols of fecundity. Two men placed at its
right and left seem to play on pandean pipes. The group on the left is formed of four
individuals, two of whom have head-dresses of royal feathers. This group is performing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page513" id="page513">[513]</a></span>
a dance, while the third group represents the same solar disk and the sacrifice
accompanied by music performed in its honor. There are also vases of different
forms containing, probably, the sacred drink, and the officiator approaching one hand
to one of the great urns, while with the other he holds the vase or the bowl from
which he is about to drink the <i>chica</i> consecrated to the sun. The princely personages
who have the right to approach the sun wear casques with royal plumes, chemisettes
extending below the middle, and ornaments at the lower part of the legs and
on the feet. The musicians, four in number (two of whom play upon the pandean
pipes and two upon the henna), are distinguished by bonnets without feathers and
by a kind of cloak tied around the neck by a band which floats behind them.
Finally, the priests, one of whom is an officiator, and the other dancers in the suite
of the princely personages, wear bonnets like that of the musicians (who very probably
belong to the same class). They have their faces painted.</p></div>

<p>A. W. Howitt, in MS. Notes on Australian Pictographs, contributes
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the most interesting of the pictorial markings used by the aborigines are
those which are made in connection with the ceremonies of initiation. I now take
as an instance the Murring tribe of the southern coast of New South Wales, whose
ceremonies I have described elsewhere. The humming instrument, which is known
in England as a child’s toy called the bull roarer, has a sacred character with all
the Australian tribes. The Murring call it Mŭdji, and the loud roaring sound made
when it is swung around at the end of a cord is considered to be the voice of Daramūlŭn,
the great supernatural being by whom, according to their tradition, these
ceremonies were first instituted.</p>

<p>On this instrument there are marked two notches, one at each end, representing
the gap left in the upper jaw of the novice after his teeth have been knocked out
during the rites; there is also figured on it the rude representations of Daramūlŭn.</p>

<p>A similar rude outline of a man in the attitude of the magic dance, being also
Daramūlŭn, is cut by the old men (wizards) at the ceremonies, upon the bark of a
tree at the spot where one of them knocks out the tooth of the novice. This pictograph
is then carefully cut out and obliterated after the ceremonies are over.</p>

<p>At a subsequent stage of the proceedings a similar figure is molded on the ground
in clay, and is surrounded by the native weapons which Daramūlŭn is said to have
invented. This figure, after having been exhibited to the novice, is also destroyed,
and they are strictly forbidden under pain of death to make them known in any manner
to “women or children;” that is to say, to the uninitiated.</p>

<p>The Mŭdji is not destroyed, but is carefully and secretly preserved by the principal
headman who had caused the ceremonies to be held.</p>

<p>The ceremonies of the Wirajuri tribe in New South Wales are substantially the
same as those of the Murring, although the tribes are several hundred miles apart.
The details, however, differ in some respects.</p>

<p>For instance, at one part of the ceremonies certain carvings are made upon the
tree adjoining the place of the ceremonies and upon the ground, as follows:</p>

<p>(1) A piece of bark is stripped off the tree from the branches spirally down the
bole to the ground. This represents the path along which Daramūlŭn is supposed
to descend from the sky to the place where the initiation is held.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page514" id="page514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The figure of Daramūlŭn is cut upon the ground, resembling that which the
Murring cut upon the tree at the place where in their ceremonies the tooth is knocked
out. The figure represents a naked black fellow dancing, his arms being slightly
extended and the legs somewhat bent outwards (sideways) at the knee, as in the
well known “corroboree” attitude.</p>

<p>(3) The representation of his tomahawk cut on the ground, where he let it fall on
reaching the earth.</p>

<p>(4) The footsteps of an emu of which Daramūlŭn was in chase.</p>

<p>(5) The figure of the emu extended on the ground where it fell when struck down
by Daramūlŭn.</p></div>

<p>The same author (<i>f</i>) remarks as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Speaking generally, it may be asserted with safety that initiation ceremonies of
some kind or other, and all having a certain fundamental identity, are practiced by
the aboriginal tribes over the whole of the Australian continent. * * *</p>

<p>Here, then, the novices for the first time witness the actual exhibition of those
magical powers of the old men of which they have heard since their earliest years.
They have been told how these men can produce from within themselves certain
deadly things which they are then able to project invisibly into those whom they
desire to injure or to kill; and now the boys see during the impressive magical
dances these very things, as they express it, “pulled out of themselves” by the
wizards.</p></div>

<p>Figs. 721, 722, and 723 are copies of the designs upon Tartar and
Mongol drums, taken from G. N. Potanin (<i>b</i>). They are used in religious
ceremonies with the belief that the sounds emanating from the
surface upon which the designs are made, or, to carry the concept a
little further, the sounds coming from the designs themselves, produce
special influences or powers. Some of these designs are notably similar
to some of those found in America and reproduced in the present
paper.</p>

<p>The upper left-hand design (<i>a</i>) in Fig. 721, on the outside of the drum,
represents the sun and the moon in the form of circles with a central
dot. Below the crossbar were two other such figures with central
dot. Besides, were represented below, on the left side, two shamans,
and under them a wild goat and serpent in the form of wavy lines; on
the right side three shamans and a deer.</p>

<p>The upper right-hand design (<i>b</i>) on the same figure is a group representing
the bringing of a horse to sacrifice. Under a rainbow, dots
represent stars, and two heavenly maidens who the shamans said were
the daughters of Ulgen and who were playing. They come down to the
mountains and rise up to the skies.</p>

<p>A bow with a knob at each end is made to represent a rainbow in
the lower part of a shaman’s drum.</p>

<p>The lower left-hand design (<i>c</i>) on the same figure on a drum of the
telengit shaman is the external delineation of a head without eyes and
nose. The lower end of the line coming from the head represents a bifurcation.
Under the head is a short horizontal line like an extended arm.
Above a line extending from side to side of the drum are two circles,
and below six circles, all empty. According to the owner of the drum<span class="pagenum"><a name="page515" id="page515">[515]</a></span>
these circles are representations of drums, and the three human figures
are masters or spirits of localities.</p>

<p>The lower right-hand design (<i>d</i>) in the same figure has in the upper
section five zigzag lines represented similar to those with which lightning
is often represented. According to the shaman these are serpents.</p>

<p>The upper left-hand design (<i>a</i>) in Fig. 722 inside the drum has painted
two trees. On each of them sits the bird karagush, with bill turned to
the left. On the left of the trees are two circles, one dark (the moon),
the other light (the sun). Below a horizontal line are depicted a frog,
a lizard, and a serpent.</p>

<p>The upper right-hand design (<i>b</i>) in the same figure has on the upper
half two circles, the sun and moon; on the left side four horsemen;
under them a bowman, also on horseback. The center is occupied by
a picture of a net and a sieve for winnowing the nuts and seeds of the
cedar tree. On the right side are two trees, baigazuin (literally the
rich birch), over which two birds, the karagush, are floating. Under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page516" id="page516">[516]</a></span>
division on the right and on the left side are oval objects with latticed-figured
or scaly skin. These are two whales. In the middle, between
them, are a frog and a deer, and below a serpent. Above, toward the
hoop of the drum, is fastened an owl’s feather.</p>

<p>The lower left hand design (<i>c</i>) in the same figure has represented in
the upper half seven figures reminding one of horses. These are the
horses, bura, going to heaven, i. e., their sacrifice. Above them are
two circles emitting light, the sun and the moon; on the right of the
horses are three trees; under a horizontal line on the left is a serpent;
on the right a fish, the kerbuleik, the whale according to Verbitski,
literally the bay-fish.</p>

<p>The lower right-hand design (<i>d</i>) in the same figure has a drawing on
the outside, a circle divided by horizontal bars into halves. The field of
the upper half is divided into three strata, the first stratum of which
is heaven, the second the rainbow, and in the lower stratum the stars.
On the left side the sun, and the crescent moon on the right side; the
goat, trees, and an undefined figure, which is not given in the drawing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page517" id="page517">[517]</a></span>
underneath. The kam, a kind of shaman, called it the bura. Some
said that it meant a cloud; others that it meant heavenly horses.</p>

<p>The left-hand design (<i>a</i>) in Fig. 723 shows four vertical and four
horizontal lines. The latter represent the rainbow; the vertical lines
borsui. Circles with dots in the center are represented in three sections,
and in the fourth one circle.</p>

<p>The right-hand design in the same figure: On the upper sections are
represented a number of human figures. These, according to the shaman’s
own explanation, are heavenly maidens (in the original Turkish,
tengriduing kuiz). Below, under a rainbow, which is represented by
three arched lines, are portrayed two serpents, each having a cross
inside. These are kurmos nuing tyungurey, i. e., the drums are kurmos’s.
Kurmos is the Alti word for spirits, which the shamans summon.</p>

<p>Bastian (<i>a</i>) makes remarks as follows concerning the magic drum of
the Shamans in the Altai, which should be considered in this connection:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Shamans admit three worlds (among the Yakuts), the world of the heavens
(hallan jurda), the middle one of the earth (outo-doidu) and the lower world or hell
(jedän tügara), the former the realm of light, the latter the realm of darkness, while
the earth has for a time been given over by the Creator (Jüt-tas-olbohtah Jürdän-Ai-Tojan)
to the will of the devil or tempter, and the souls of men at their death,
according to the measure of their merit, are sent into one or the other realm. When,
however, the earth world has come to an end, the souls of the two realms will wage
a war against each other, and victory must remain on the side of the good souls.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 6.<br />

<span class="subhead">MORTUARY PRACTICES.</span></h3>

<p>Champlain (<i>f</i>) in his voyage of 1603, says of the Northeastern Algonquins
that their graves were covered with large pieces of wood, and
one post was erected upon them, the upper part of which was painted
red.</p>

<p>The same author, in 1613, writing of the Algonquins of the Ottawa<span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518">[518]</a></span>
river, at the Isle des Alumettes, gives more details of the pictures on
their grave posts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On it the likeness of the man or woman who is buried there is roughly engraved.
If a man, they put on a buckler, a spear, war club, and bows and arrows. If he is a
chief he will have a plume on his head and some other designs or ornaments. If a
boy, they give him one bow and a single arrow. If a woman or girl, they put on a
kettle, an earthen pot, a wooden spoon, and a paddle. The wooden tomb is 6 or 7
feet long and 4 wide, painted yellow and red.</p></div>

<p>Some northern tribes&mdash;probably Cree&mdash;according to the Jesuit Relations
(<i>a</i>), gave a notice of death to absent relations or dear friends of
the deceased by hanging the object signifying his name on the path
by which the traveler must return, e. g., if the name of the deceased
was Piré (Partridge) the skin of a partridge was suspended. The main
object of the notice was that the traveler, thereby knowing of the death,
should not on his return to the lodge or village ask after or mention
the deceased. Perhaps this explains the custom of placing pictographs
of personal names and totemic marks on some prominent point or on
trails without any apparent incident.</p>

<p>The same Relation describes a custom of the same Indians of shaping
out of wood a portraiture of the more distinguished dead and inserting
it over their graves, afterwards painting and greasing it as if it were
the live man.</p>

<p>In Keating’s Long (<i>g</i>) it is told that the Sac Indians are particular
in their demonstrations of grief for departed friends. These consist in
darkening their faces with charcoal, fasting, abstaining from the use
of vermillion and other ornaments in dress, etc. They also make incisions
in their arms, legs, and other parts of the body; these are not
made for the purposes of mortification, or to create a pain which shall by
dividing their attention efface the recollection of their loss, but entirely
from a belief that their grief is internal and that the only way of dispelling
it is to give it a vent through which to escape.</p>

<p>This is an explanation of the practice which has been verified in the
field work of the Bureau of Ethnology and corresponds with the concept
of finding relief from disease and pain by similar incisions, to let
out the supposed invading entity that causes distress.</p>

<p>The same authority, p. 332, gives the following account of Dakota
burial scaffolds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On these scaffolds, which are from 8 to 10 feet high, corpses were deposited in a
box made from part of a broken canoe. Some hair was suspended which we at first
mistook for a scalp; but our guide informed us that these were locks of hair torn
from their heads by the relations to testify their grief. In the center, between the
four posts which supported the scaffold, a stake was planted in the ground; it was
about 6 feet high, and bore an imitation of human figures; five of which had a design
of a petticoat, indicating them to be females; the rest, amounting to seven, were
naked, and were intended for male figures. Of the latter, four were headless, showing
that they had been slain; the three other male figures were unmutilated but
held a staff in their hands which, as our guide informed us, designated that they were
slaves. The post, which is an usual accompaniment to the scaffold that supports a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page519" id="page519">[519]</a></span>
warrior’s remains, does not represent the achievements of the deceased, but those of
the warriors that assembled near his remains, danced the dance of the post, and related
their martial exploits.</p></div>

<p>Maximilian, Prince of Wied (<i>d</i>), tells that as a sign of mourning the
Sioux daub themselves with white clay.</p>

<p>According to Powers, (<i>d</i>) “A Yokaia widow’s style of mourning is
peculiar. In addition to the usual evidence of grief she mingles the
ashes of the dead husband with pitch, making a white tar or ungent
with which she smears a band about two inches wide all around the
edge of her hair (which is previously cut off close to the head), so that
at a little distance she appears to be wearing a white chaplet.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dorsey reports that mud is used by a mourner in the sacred-bag
war party among the Osages. Several modes of showing mourning by
styles of paint and markings are presented in this paper under the
headings of Color and of Tattooing. Other practices connected with the
present topic, and which may explain some pictographs, are described
in the work of Dr. H. C. Yarrow, acting assistant surgeon, U. S. Army,
on The Mortuary Customs of the North American Indians, in the First
Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.</p>

Alaska.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 724 is copied from a piece of ivory in the museum of the Alaska
Commercial Company, San Francisco, California, and was interpreted
by an Alaskan native in San Francisco in 1882.</p>

<p>First is a votive offering or “shaman stick,” erected to the memory of
one departed. The “bird” carvings are considered typical of “good
spirits,” and the above was erected by the
remorse-stricken individual, who had killed
the person shown.</p>

<p>The headless body represents the man who
was killed. In this respect the Ojibwa manner
of drawing a person “killed” is similar.</p>

<p>The right hand Indian represents the homicide
who erected the “grave-post” or “sacred
stick.” The arm is thrown earthward, resembling the Blackfeet and
Dakota gesture for “kill.”</p>

<p>That portion of the Kauvuya tribe of Indians in Southern California
known as the Playsanos, or <i>lowlanders</i>, formerly inscribed characters
upon the gravestones of their dead, relating to the pursuits or good
qualities of the deceased. Dr. W. J. Hoffman obtained several pieces
or slabs of finely-grained sandstone near Los Angeles, California, during
the summer of 1884, which had been used for this purpose. Upon
these were the drawings, in incised lines, of the fin back whale, with
figures of men pursuing them with harpoons. Around the drawings
were close parallel lines with cross lines similar to those made on ivory
by the southern Innuit of Alaska.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page520" id="page520">[520]</a></span></p>

<p>Figs. 725 to 727 were procured from a native Alaskan by
Dr. Hoffman in 1882, and explained to him to be drawings
made upon grave posts.</p>

<p>Fig. 725 commemorates a hunter, as land animals are
shown to be his chief pursuit. The following is the explanation
of the characters:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The baidarka, or boat, holding two persons; the occupants
are shown, as are also the paddles, which project
below the horizontal body of the vessel.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> A rack for drying skins and fish. A pole is added

cloth.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> A fox.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> A land otter.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> The hunter’s summer habitation. These are temporary
dwellings and usually constructed at a distance
from home. This also indicates the profession of a skin-hunter,
as the permanent lodges, indicated as winter
houses, i. e., with round or dome-like roof, are located near the seashore,
and summer houses are only needed when at some distance from
home, where a considerable length of time is spent in hunting.</p>

<p>Fig. 727 is a drawing of a village and neighboring burial-ground,
prepared by an Alaskan native in imitation of originals
seen by him among the natives of the mainland of
Alaska, especially the Aigalúqamut. Carvings are generally
on walrus ivory; sometimes on wooden slats. In the figure, <i>g</i>

inscription similar in general character to those in the last two preceding

<p><i>e.</i> An elevated structure used for the storage of food.</p>

small lines, with ball attached, are ornamental appendages consisting
of strips of cloth or skin, with charms, or, sometimes, tassels.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Grave post, bearing rude illustrations
of the weapons or implements
used by the deceased during his life.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> A grave scaffold, containing
adult. Besides the ornamental appendages,
as in <i>f</i> preceding, there is
a “Shaman stick” erected over the
box containing the corpse as a mark
of good wishes of a sorrowing survivor.
See object <i>a</i>, in Fig. 724.</p>

<p>Schoolcraft (<i>m</i>) gives a good account,
with illustration, of the burial
posts used by the Sioux and Chippewas.
It has been quoted so frequently
that it is not reproduced

with the posts is that the totems
depicted on them are reversed,
to signify the death of the persons
buried.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 728 represents the grave post
of a Menomoni Indian of the bear
totem. The stick is a piece of pine
board 2&frac12; inches wide at the top,
gradually narrowing down to a point;
three-fourths of an inch thick, and
about 2 feet long. On one side are
two sets of characters, the oldest
being incised with a sharp-pointed
nail, while over these are a later set
of drawings made with red ocher, represented
in the illustration by shading.
The figure of the bear, drawn
with head to the ground, denotes the
totem of which the deceased was a
member, the remaining incised figures
relating to some exploits the signification
of which was not known.
The red marks were put upon the
stick at the time of the holding of a
memorial service, when the father of
the deceased furnished a feast to the
medicine priests just previous to his
being received into the society of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page522" id="page522">[522]</a></span>
shamans to fill the vacancy caused by
the death. The number of red crosses
denote the number of speeches made
at the grave upon that occasion,
while the band at the top refers to
the person acting as master of ceremonies,
who had been requested to
make all the arrangements for the
medicine ceremonies and initiation.
So said some Menomoni in the neighborhood,
but later the Indian who
actually painted the red crosses came
to Washington and explained that
they signified the number of war
parties in which the deceased had
taken part.</p>

<p>Before the grave is a small board,
upon which tobacco is placed to
gratify the taste of the dead, and
during the season of sugar making
pieces of that delicacy are pushed
through the small openings in the
head board, that the spirit of the deceased
may be gratified and give success
to the donors at future seasons.</p>

<p>The right-hand grave box is that
of another member of the family of
Oshkosh, at which the board, with
tobacco, is also placed, as well as
the grave post. This, however, does
not bear any indications of characters,
which probably had been washed
off by the rain.</p>

<p>Pieces of bark, stones, and sticks
are also placed upon the grave boxes,
but the signification of this practice
could not be ascertained.</p>

</div>

<p>Lewis and Clarke (<i>c</i>) mention the Chilluckittequaws, a division of
the Chinooks of the Columbia river, as having for burial purposes
vaults made of pine or cedar boards, closely connected, about 8 feet
square and 6 in height. The walls as well as the door were decorated
with strange figures cut and painted on them; besides these there
were several wooden images of men, some of them so old and decayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page524" id="page524">[524]</a></span>
as to have almost lost their shape, which were all placed against
the sides of the vaults. These images do not appear to be at all the
objects of adoration, but were probably intended as resemblances of
those whose decease they indicate.</p>

</div>

<p>Whymper (<i>a</i>) reports that the Kalosh Indians of Alaska construct
grave boxes or tombs which contain only the ashes of the dead. These
people invariably burn the deceased. On one of the boxes he saw a
number of faces painted, long tresses of human hair depending therefrom.
Each head represented a victim of the deceased man’s ferocity.
Thus the pictures are not likenesses or totemic marks of the cremated
Kalosh, but of enemies whom he had killed, being in the nature of
trophies or proofs of valor. Fig. 733 is a reproduction of the illustration.</p>

<p>Dall (<i>c</i>) says of the Yukon Indians:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some wore hoops of birch wood around the neck and wrists, with various patterns
and figures cut on them. These were said to be emblems of mourning for the dead.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Franz Boas (<i>f</i>) gives the following account of the funeral customs
practiced by the Snanaimuq, a Salish tribe:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The face of the deceased is painted with red and black paint. * * * A chief’s
body is put in a carved box and the front posts supporting his coffin are carved. His
mask is placed between these posts. The graves of great warriors are marked by a
statue representing a warrior with a war club. * * * After the death of husband
or wife, the survivor must paint his legs and his blanket red. * * * At the
end of the mourning period the red blanket is given to an old man, who deposits it
in the woods.</p></div>

<p>Didron (<i>a</i>) speaks of emblems on tombstones:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Even today, at Constantinople, in the cemetery of the Armenians, every tombstone
is marked with the insignia of the profession followed by the defunct which
the stone covers. For an Armenian tailor there is a pair of shears, thread, and
needles; for a mason, hammer and trowel; for a shoemaker, a last, leather, and a
leather cutter; for a grocer, a pair of scales; for a banker, pieces of money. It is
the same with others. Among us [Frenchmen], in the middle ages, a compass, a
rule, and square are engraved on the tomb of Hugues Libergier. In the cemetery
of L’Est, at Paris, a palette indicates the grave of a painter, a chisel and hammer
mark that of a sculptor. Animals are represented as talking and acting, masks
grimace and smile, to announce in the same inclosure the tombs of La Fontaine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page525" id="page525">[525]</a></span>
of Molière. Among the Romans it was the same: a fisher had a boat on his tomb;
a shepard, a sheep; a digger, a pickaxe; a navigator, an anchor or a trident; a vine-dresser,
a cask; an architect, a capital or the instruments of his art.</p></div>

<p>Hewitt (<i>g</i>) says of the Dieri, a tribe of Central Australia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A messenger who is sent to convey the intelligence of a death is smeared all over
with white clay. On his approach to the camp the women all commence screaming
and crying most passionately. After a time the particulars of the death are made
known to the camp. The near relations and friends then only weep. Old men even
cry bitterly, and their friends comfort them as if they were children. On the following
day the near relations dress in mourning by smearing themselves over with white
clay. Widows and widowers are prohibited by custom from uttering a word until
the clay has worn off, however long it may remain on them. They do not, however,
rub it off, as doing so would be considered a bad omen. It must absolutely wear off
of itself. During this period they communicate by means of gesture language.</p></div>

<div class="parallel">

<p>Dr. Ferdinand von Hochstetter (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The carved Maori figures which are met with on the road are the memorials of
chiefs who, while journeying to the restorative baths of Rotorua, succumbed to their
ills on the road. Some of the figures are decked out with pieces of clothing or kerchiefs;
and the most remarkable feature in them is the close imitation of the tattooing
of the deceased, by which the Maoris are able to recognize for whom the monument
has been erected. Certain lines are peculiar to the tribe, others to the family,
and again others to the individual. A close imitation of the tattooing of the face,
therefore, is to the Maori the same as to us a photographic likeness; it does not require
any description of name.</p></div>

<p>Ball, on Nicobarese Ideographs, in Jour. Anthrop. Inst. of Gr. Br.
&amp; I. (<i>d</i>), says, describing Fig. 736, which appears to be connected with
mortuary observances:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page527" id="page527">[527]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The example of Nicobarese picture writing in Fig. 736 was obtained in the year
1873 on the island of Kondul, where I found it hanging in the house of a man who
was said to have died a short time previously. * * *</p>

<p>The material of which it is made is either the glume of a bamboo or the spathe of
a palm which has been flattened out and framed with split bamboos.</p>

<p>It is about 3 feet long by 18 inches broad. The objects are painted with vermilion,
their outlines being surrounded with punctures, which allow the light to pass
through. * * *</p>

<p>As in all such Nicobarese paintings, figures of the sun, moon, and stars occupy
prominent positions. Now, the sun and moon are stated, by those who have known
the Nicobarese best, to be especial objects of adoration, and therefore these paintings
may have some religious significance.</p>

<p>At first it occurred to me that this was merely an inventory of the property of
the deceased, but as some of the objects are certainly not such as we should expect
to find in an enumeration of property, e. g., the lizard, while the figures of men appear
to portray particular emotions, it seems probable that the objects represented
have a more or less conventional meaning, and that we have here a document of as
bona fide and translatable a character as an Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription.</p>

<p>My own efforts to discover an interpretation from the natives on the spot were
not crowned with success. * * *</p>

<p>Mr. De Röepstorff, extra assistant superintendent of the Andamans and Nicobars,
to whom I applied for such information as he might be able to collect upon the subject,
assured me by letter, in 1873, that the screens had a religious significance and
were used to exorcise spirits, but he did not seem to regard them as capable of being
interpreted. * * *</p>

<p>The following is a list of the objects depicted, besides animals; many of the common
utensils in use in a Nicobarese household are included:</p>

<p>(1) The sun and stars; (2) the moon and stars; (3) swallows or (?) flying fish;
(4) impression of the forepart of a human foot; (5) a lizard (Hydrosaurus?); (6)
four men in various attitudes; (7) two dás for cutting jungle; (8) two earthen

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<span class="subhead">CUSTOMS.</span></h2>


<p>The notes given under this heading are divided into (1) cult societies;
(2) daily life and habits; (3) games.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">CULT SOCIETIES.</span></h3>

<p>Voluntary associations, to be distinguished from those of an exclusively
religious character, have flourished among most Indian tribes
and are still found among those least affected by contact with civilization.
Maj. Powell, the Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, has
named them cult societies. Their members are designated by special
paintings and marks entirely distinct from those relating to their clans
or gentes and their personal names. Travelers have frequently been
confused by the diversity of such designations.</p>

<p>The translated names of some of these societies found among the
Sioux are “Brave Night Hearts,” “Owl Feathers,” and “Wolves and
Foxes.” They control tribes in internal affairs and strongly influence
their policy in external relations, and may be regarded as the substitute
both for regular soldiery and for police. It is necessary that a young
man proposing to be a warrior should be initiated into some one of
these societies. But in distinguishing them from the purely shamanistic
orders it must not be understood that their ceremonies and ties are
independent of the cult of religion, or that they disregard it, for this
among Indians would be impossible.</p>

<p>The following account of these societies among the Blackfeet or
Satsika and their pictorial or objective devices is condensed from
Maximilian of Wied’s Travels (<i>e</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The bands, unions, or associations are found among the Blackfeet as well as all
the other American tribes. They have a certain name, fixed rules and laws, as well
as their peculiar songs and dances, and serve in part to preserve order in the camp,
on the march, in the hunting parties, etc. Seven such bands or unions among the
Blackfeet were mentioned to me. They are the following: (1) The band of the
mosquitos. This union has no police business to do, but consists of young people,
many of whom are only 8 or 10 years of age. There are also some young men among
them and sometimes even a couple of old men, in order to see to the observance of
the laws and regulations. This union performs wild, youthful pranks; they run
about the camp whenever they please; pinch, nip, and scratch men, women, and
children in order to give annoyance like the mosquitos. The young people begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="page529" id="page529">[529]</a></span>
with this union and then gradually rise higher through the others. As the badge
of their band they wear an eagle’s claw fastened around the wrist with a leather
strap. They have also a particular mode of painting themselves, like every other
band, and their peculiar songs and dance. (2) The dogs. Its badge is not known
to me; it consists of young married men, and the number is not limited. (3) The
prairie dogs. This is a police union, which receives married men; its badge is a
long hooked stick wound round with otter skin, with knots of white skin at intervals,
and a couple of eagle’s feathers hanging from each of them. (4) Those who
carry the raven. Its badge is a long staff covered with red cloth, to which black
ravens’ feathers in a long thick row are fastened from one end to the other. They
contribute to the preservation of order and the police. (5) The buffalo, with thin
horns. When they dance they wear horns on their caps. If disorders take place
they must help the soldiers, who mark out the camp and then take the first place.
(6) The soldiers. They are the most distinguished warriors, who exercise the
police, especially in the camp and on the march; in public deliberations they have
the casting vote whether, for instance, they shall hunt, change their abode, make
war or conclude peace, etc. They carry as their badge a wooden club the breadth
of a hand, with hoofs of the buffalo cow hanging to the handle. They are sometimes
40 or 50 men in number. (7) The buffalo bulls. They form the first, that is, the
most distinguished, of all the unions, and are the highest in rank. They carry in
their hand a medicine badge, hung with buffalo hoofs, which they rattle when
they dance to their peculiar song. They are too old to attend to the police, having
passed through all the unions, and are considered as having retired from office. In
their medicine dance they wear on their head a cap made of the long forelock and
mane of the buffalo bull, which hangs down to a considerable length.</p></div>

An instance is given in Fig. 738 which is instructive in the

which had been made and used by Ottawa Indians. On each side are
four spaces, upon each of which are various incised characters, three
spaces on one side being reserved for the delineation of human figures,
each having diverging lines from the head upward, denoting their
social status as chiefs or warriors and medicine men.</p>

<p>Upon the space nearest the mouth is the drawing of a fire, the flames
passing upward from the horizontal surface beneath them. The cross
bands are raised portions of the wood (ash) of which the pipestem

through the stem, though not interfering with the tube necessary for
the passage of the smoke. This indicates considerable mechanical
skill.</p>

<p>Upon each side of the stem are spaces
corresponding in length and position to

indicating that the two persons in the
corresponding space on the opposite side
belong to the bear gens. The next upper
figure is that of a beaver, showing the
three human figures to belong to the
beaver gens, while the next to this, the
eagle, means that the opposite persons are
members of the eagle gens. The upper
figure is that of a lodge which contains
a council fire, shown on the opposite side.</p>

<p>The signification of the whole is that
two members of the bear gens, three members
of the beaver gens, and three members
of the eagle gens have united and
constitute a society living in one lodge,

</div>

<p>Fig. 739, printed from the Kejimkoojik
rocks, in Nova Scotia, represents two Indians
in a canoe following a fish to shoot
it. This is not a pure example of the class
of totemic designs. Both Indians in the
canoe have paddles in which the device
resembles the Micmac tribal device, but
in that the hunters pursue a deer and not
a fish and the canoe is “humpback.” The
Passamaquoddy tribal pictographic sign
in which a fish is followed, requires both
Indians to have paddles, and, it may be
understood that the two Indians in the
canoe are Passamaquoddy, but in the figure
one of them has laid aside his paddle
and is shooting at the fish with a gun,
which departs from the totemic device,
and also shows that the drawing was made
since the Indians of the region had obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="page531" id="page531">[531]</a></span>
firearms from Europeans, but these were obtained three centuries
ago, quite long enough for hunting scenes on some of the petroglyphs
to exhibit the use of a gun instead of a bow.</p>

<p>This kind of fish hunting by gunshot is one of daily occurrence in the
region during the proper season.</p>

<p>Fig. 740, from the same locality, is more ideographic. The line of
the gun barrel is exaggerated and prolonged so as nearly to touch the
fish, and signifies that the shot was a sure hit. The hunters are very

a brazier and screens, a common practice which seems to be indicated.</p>

<p>A similar hunting scene by canoe, in which, however, the game was
deer, is given in Fig. 743. The drawing is on birch bark, and was made
by an old Indian named Ojibwa, now living at White Earth, Minnesota,
an intimate friend and associate of the late chief Hole-in-the-Day.
Ojibwa is supposed to be actor as well as depictor. He shows his
lodges in <i>a</i>, where he resided many years ago; <i>b</i> is a lake; <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>
represent four deer, one of which is shown only by the horns protruding

acting as a reflector. The whole means that during one hunt, by night,
the narrator shot four deer at the places indicated.</p>

<p>The accompanying Fig. 744 is reproduced from a drawing also incised
on birch bark by Ojibwa, and relates to a hunting expedition made by
his father and two companions, all of whom are represented by three
human forms near the left-hand upper line. The circle at the left is
Red Cedar lake, Minnesota; a river is shown flowing northward, and
another toward the east, having several indications of lakes which this
river passes through or drains. The circle within the lake denotes an
island upon which the party camped, as is shown by the trail leading
from the human forms to the island. Around the lake are a number of
short lines which signify trees, indicating a wooded shore. The first
animal form to the right of the human figures is a porcupine; the next
a bittern. The two shelters in the right-hand upper corner indicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page533" id="page533">[533]</a></span>
another camp made by the hunters, to which one of them dragged a
deer, as shown by the man in that act, just to the left of the shelter.</p>

<p>Another camp of the same party of three is shown in the lower left-hand
corner; the bow and arrow directed to the right indicates that
there they shot a raccoon, a fisher, a duck (a man lying down decoyed
this bird by calling), a mink, and an otter. The line above the lower
row consists of the following animals, reading from the left to right, viz,
bear, owl, wolf, elk, and deer.</p>

<p>Fig. 746 was also made by Lean-Wolf, and illustrates the old manner
of hunting antelope and deer. The hunter would disguise himself by
covering his head with the head and skin of an antelope, and so be
enabled to approach the game near enough to use his bow and arrow.</p>

<p>In a similar manner the Hidatsa would mask themselves with a wolf
skin to enable them to approach buffalo. This is illustrated in Fig.
747, which is a reproduction of a drawing made by the above-mentioned
chief.</p>

<p>The next group of figures illustrates the custom of gaining and afterwards
counting coups or hits, the French expression, sometimes spelled
by travelers “coo,” being generally adopted. This is an honor gained
by hitting an enemy, whether dead or alive, with an ornamented lance,
or sometimes a stick, carried for the purpose as part of a warrior’s
equipment. These sticks or wands are about 12 feet long, often of willow,
stripped of leaves and bark, and each having some distinguishing
objects, such as feathers, bells, brightly-colored cloth, or else painted
in a special manner. Further remarks on this custom appear in Chapter

<p>Fig. 749.&mdash;Killed-First. Red Cloud’s Census. This
is the case where a warrior struck the enemy with his
coup stick first in order, which is the most honorable
achievement, greater than the actual killing. The
word translated kill or killed does not always imply
immediate death, but the infliction of a fatal wound.</p>

<p>The apparent reason why the striking of the body
of a dead or disabled enemy, whether or not killed
or disabled by the striker, is more honorable than
the actual infliction of the wound, is because the
attempt to strike is vigorously resisted by the enemy,
the survivors of which assemble to prevent the successful
achievement; mere killing might be at a
distance in comparative safety.</p>

<p>Fig. 763.&mdash;A Ree woman is killed by a Dakota while
gathering pomme-blanche. The-Flame’s Winter Count,
1797-’98. Pomme-blanche, or navet de prairie, is a
white root, somewhat similar in appearance to a white
turnip, botanically Psoralea esculenta (Nuttal) sometimes
P. argophylla. It is a favorite food of the Indians,
eaten boiled down to a sort of mush or hominy.
A forked stick is used in gathering these roots.</p>

The pipe is not in the man’s hand, and the head only

<p>An interesting custom of the Indians connected
with the rite of sanctuary is that called by English
writers “running the gauntlet.” When captives had
successfully run through a line of tormentors to a
post near the council-house they were for the time
free from further molestation. In the northeastern tribes this was in
the nature of an ordeal to test whether or not the captive was vigorous
and brave enough to be adopted into the tribe, but among other tribes
it appears in a different shape. Any enemy, whether a captive or not,
could secure immunity from present danger if he could reach a central
post, or if there were no post, the lodge or tipi of the chief. A similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="page539" id="page539">[539]</a></span>
custom existed among the Arikaras, who kept a special pipe in a “bird-box.”
If a criminal or enemy succeeded in smoking the pipe contained
in the box he could not be hurt. This corresponds with the safety
found in laying hold of the horns of the Israelite altar.</p>

<p>The position of the pipe is significant. Its mouthpiece points to the
entrance of the tipi. The visitor does not bring or offer peace, but
hopes that the tribe visited may grant it to him.</p>

<p>The four figures next following refer to ceremonies by which a war
party was organized among some of the tribes of the Plains. A brief
account of the ceremonies specially relating to the pipe is as follows:</p>

<p>When a warrior desires to make up a war party he visits his friends
and offers them a filled pipe as an invitation to follow him, and those
who are willing to go accept the invitation by lighting and smoking it.
Among the Dakotas this was succeeded by a muster feast and war dance.
Any man whose courage has been proved may become the leader of
a war party. The word leader has been generally translated “partisan,”
an expression originally adopted by the French voyageurs. Among the
Arapahos the would-be leader does not invite anyone to accompany
him, but publicly announces his intention of going to war. He fixes
the day for his departure, and states where he will camp the first
night, naming some place not far off. The morning on which he starts,
and before leaving the village, he invokes the aid of his guardian totem.
He rides off alone, carrying his bare pipe in his hand with the bowl
carefully tied to the stem to prevent it from slipping off. If the bowl
should at any time accidentally fall to the ground he considers it an
evil omen and immediately returns to the village, and nothing could
induce him to proceed, as he thinks that only misfortune would attend
him if he did. Sometimes he ties eagle or hawk plumes to the stem of
his pipe, and after quitting the village, repairs to the top of some hill
and makes an offering of them to the sun, taking them from his pipe
and tying them to a pole which he erects in a pile of stones. Those
who intend to follow him usually join him at the first camp, equipped
for the expedition; but often there are some who do not join him until
he has gone further on. He eats nothing before leaving the village,
nor as long as the sun is up; but breaks his fast at his first camp after
the sun sets. The next morning he begins another fast, to be continued
until sunset. He counts his party, saddles his horse, names some place
6 or 7 miles ahead, where he says he will halt for awhile, and again
rides off alone with his pipe in his hand. After awhile the party follow
him in single file. When they have reached his halting place he tells
them to dismount and let their horses graze. They all then seat themselves
on the ground on the left of the leader, forming a semicircle
facing the sun. The leader fills his pipe, all bow their heads, and,
pointing the stem of the pipe upward, he prays toward the sun, asking
that they may find an abundance of game, that dead shots may be made,
so that their ammunition will not be wasted, but reserved for their
enemies; that they may easily find their enemies and kill them; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page540" id="page540">[540]</a></span>
they may be preserved from wounds and death. He makes his petition
four times, then lights his pipe, and after sending a few whiffs of smoke
skyward as incense to the sun, hands the pipe to his neighbor who
smokes and passes it on to the next. It is passed from one to another
toward the left, until all have smoked, the leader refilling it as often
as necessary. They then proceed to their next camp, where probably
others join them. The same programme is carried out for three or four
days before the party is prepared for action.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As soon as the mother was delivered of the infant they put it into a cradle and
when it was 4 days old the midwife took the infant in her arms, naked, and carried
it into the court of the mother’s house, in which court was strewed reeds, or rushes,
which they call tule, upon which was placed a small vessel of water in which the
midwife bathed the infant; and after she had bathed it 3 boys being seated near the
said rushes, eating roasted maize mixed with boiled beans, which kind of food they
named yxcue, which provision or paste they set before the said boys in order that
they might eat it. After the bathing, or washing, the midwife desired the boys to
pronounce the name aloud, bestowing a new name on the infant which had been
thus bathed; and the name that they gave it was that which the midwife wished.
They first carried out the infant to bathe it. If it was a boy they carried him, holding
his symbol in his hand, which symbol was the instrument which the father of
the infant employed either in the military profession or in his trade, whether it was
that of a goldsmith, jeweller, or any other; and the said ceremony having been gone
through, the midwife delivered the infant to his mother. But if the infant was a
girl the symbol with which they carried her to be bathed was a spinning wheel and
distaff, with a small basket and a handful of brooms which were the things which
would afford her occupation when she arrived at a proper age.</p>

<p>They offered the umbilical cord of the male infant together with the shield and
arrows, the symbols with which they carried him to be bathed, in that spot and
place where war was likely to happen with their enemies, where they buried them
in the earth; and they did the same with that of the female infant, which they in
the same way buried beneath the metate or stone on which they ground meal.</p>

<p>After these ceremonies, when twenty days had expired, the parents of the infant
went with it to the temple, or mesquita, which they called calmecac, and in the
presence of their alfaquis presented the infant with its offering of mantles and
maxtles, together with some provision; and after the infant had been brought up
by its parents, as soon as it arrived at the proper age, they delivered him to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page543" id="page543">[543]</a></span>
superior of the said mezquita, that he might be there instructed in order that he
might afterwards become an alfaqui; but if the parents resolved that when the
infant attained a fit age he should go and serve in the military profession, they immediately
offered him to the master, making a promise of him, which master of the
young men and boys was named Teachcauh or Telpuchtlato; which offering they
accompanied with a present of provisions and other things for its celebration; and
when the infant attained a fit age they delivered him up to the said master.</p></div>

<p>Those contained in the first section signify that the father, who had
sons nearly grown up, carried them to the two houses represented in
the plate; either to the house of the master, who taught and instructed
the young men, or to the mezquita, accordingly as the lad was himself
inclined, and committed him to the care of the superior Alfaqui or to
the master of the boys, to be educated, which lads it was fit should
have attained the age of 15.</p>

<p>In this section <i>a</i> is a youth of 15 years of age, whose father delivers
him up to the superior Alfaqui, that he might receive him as an Alfaqui;

<p>The second section of the plate signifies the laws and usages which
they followed and observed in marriages. The ceremony consisted in
the female negotiator, who arranged the nuptials, carrying on her back
on the first night of the wedding the betrothed woman, accompanied
by four women with blazing torches of resinous fir, who attended to
light her on the way; and having arrived at the house of the man to
whom she was engaged, the parents of the betrothed man went out to
receive her in the court of the house and conducted her to an apartment
where the man expected her; and seating the betrothed couple on a
mat on which were placed seats, near a hearth of fire, they took them
and tied them to each other by their clothes and offered incense of copal
to their gods. Two old men and two women afterward delivered a
separate discourse to the newly married couple and set food before
them, which they presently ate; and after their repast was over, the
two old men and women gave good advice to the married pair, telling
them how they ought to conduct themselves and to live, and by what
means they might pass their lives in tranquillity.</p>

<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">GAMES.</span></h3>

<p>Many accounts of the games of the Indians have been published, but
they are not often connected with pictography. Those now presented
refer to the picturing connected with only three games.</p>

<p>Battiste Good’s record further explains the illustration
by the account that the Dakota was killed in a
fight with the Pawnees, and his companions left his
body where they supposed it would not be found, but
the Pawnees found it, and, as it was frozen stiff, they
dragged it into their camp and played haka with it.</p>

<p>The characters <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, Fig. 774, represent one point of view of two
of a set of Haida gambling sticks, real size. They are made of juniper
or some other similar wood, and neatly carved with diverse figures.
The game is played by any number of persons, and it would seem with
any number of marked sticks. A dealer sits on the ground with a pile
of shredded cedar bark in front of him, and with much ceremony draws
out the sticks one by one without looking at them and passes them to
the players, in turn, who sit in front of him.</p>

<p>Each device counts a certain number, in a manner similar to the
devices on ordinary playing cards, and the winning is by the high and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page548" id="page548">[548]</a></span>
low or the definite and specific values of the sticks decided upon in
variations of the games. These sticks are cylindrical, and to illustrate
the characters on them, <i>c</i> is presented, which shows the whole round
of the character <i>b</i>. This exhibits the typical Haida style. An excellent
collection of these pictured sticks is in the U. S. National Museum,
No. 73552.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Fewkes (<i>c</i>) reports as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the very interesting games played by the Hopi Indians is one of ethnological
interest, which is allied to a game described by the early Spanish historians
of the Mexicans. This game, to-to-lós-pi, resembles somewhat the game of checkers
and can be played by two persons or by two parties. In playing the game a rectangular
figure, divided into a large number of squares, is drawn upon the rock, either
by scratching or by using a different colored stone as a crayon. (Figures of this
game formerly existed on the rocks near the village of Wál-pi.) A diagonal line,
tūh-ki-o-ta, is drawn across the rectangle from northwest to southeast, and the players
station themselves at each end of this line.</p>

<p>When two parties play, a single person acts as player and the other members of
the party act as advisers. The first play is won by tossing up a leaf or corn husk
with one side blackened. The pieces which are used are bean or corn kernels, stones,
and wood, or small fragments of any substance of marked color. The players were
stationed at each end of the diagonal line, tūh-ki-o-ta. They move their pieces upon
this line, but never across it. The moves which are made are intricate and the
player may move one or more pieces successively. Certain positions entitle him to
this privilege. He may capture or, as he terms it, kill one or more of his opponent’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="page549" id="page549">[549]</a></span>
pieces at one play. In this respect the game is not unlike checkers, and to capture
the pieces of the opponent seems to be the main object of the game. The checkers,
however, must be concentrated and always moved towards the southeast corner.</p>

<p>This game is now rarely played on the East Mesa, but is still used at O-rai-be. It
is said to have been played in ancient times by the sun and moon or by other mythical
personages.</p>

<p>Turning now to old Mexico, we find that the Spanish chronicles give an account
of a Mexican game called patolli, which was played with colored stones. The
squares were made of a cross-shaped figure, and the stones were moved according to
the throws of beans which were marked upon one side.</p></div>

<p>A discussion of the “ghost gamble,” with many illustrations, some
of which show marks which, in a broad sense, may be classed as pictographic,
is published in the paper “Study of the mortuary customs
of the North American Indians,” by Dr. H. C. Yarrow (<i>a</i>), U. S. Army.</p>

<p>Colored pebbles found in the grotto of Mas d’Azil, in the department
of the Ariège, France, have lately awakened some discussion. These
pebbles were selected as being narrow and flat, and, with rare exceptions,
are no more than 9 centimeters in length. They were colored
with red oxide of iron. Many of the designs could have been made by
the end of a finger anointed with the coloring matter, but others would
have required a small pencil. The coloring matter was thick and probably
fixed by grease or glue, which time has destroyed. The color now
disappears on the least rubbing. Its preservation until now has been
owing to the fact that the pebbles were left undisturbed in the cindery
layer where they were deposited. Only one of the faces of the pebbles
bears a design, and generally their border is ornamented by a narrow
band of red, resembling a frame to the design, the color being applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="page550" id="page550">[550]</a></span>
in the same manner as to the latter. Fig. 775 gives examples though
without color of these pebbles. They are selected from a plate in
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Anthropologie</span> (<i>d</i>) illustrating the text by Émile Cartailbac, who
declines to offer any hypothesis concerning the use of these objects.
But to an observer familiar with the gambling games of the North
American Indians in which marked plum stones, and similar objects
are employed, these stained flat pebbles at once suggest their use to
decide the values in a game by the several designs and by the pebbles
falling on the figured or on the unmarked side.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<span class="subhead">HISTORY.</span></h2>


<p>It is seldom possible to distinguish by pictographs, or indeed to
decide from oral accounts obtained from Indians, whether those purporting
to be historical have a genuine basis or are merely traditions
connected with myths. This chapter may therefore be correlated with
Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span>, section <a href="#page250">5</a>, which has special relation to traditions as mnemonically
pictured. The notes now following are considered to refer
to actual events or to explain the devices used in the record of such
events.</p>

<p>The account by Dr. Brinton (<i>c</i>) of the Walum-Olum or bark record
of the Lenni-Lenapé, as also some of Schoolcraft’s pictographic illustrations,
may with some propriety be regarded as historic, but are so
well known that their specific citation is needless.</p>

<p>The American Indians have not produced detailed historic pictures,
such as appear on the Column of Trajan, and the Bayeux tapestry, with
such excellence in art as to be self-interpreting. Neither do they equal
in this respect the Egyptian and Assyrian sculptures, which portray
the ordering of battle, the engineering work of sieges, the plan of
camps, and the tactical moves of chieftains. Those sculptures also
depict the whole civil and domestic lives of the peoples of the several
nations. In some of these particulars the Mexicans approached these
graphic details, as is shown below, but, as a rule, in the three divisions
of America, history was noted and preserved by ideographic methods
supplementing the incompleteness of artistic skill.</p>

<p>With regard to the advance gained by the Mexicans reference is
made, with regret that copious quotation is impossible, to the essay of
Henry Phillips, jr. (<i>a</i>), and to the monumental work of Eugène Boban,
before cited. It will be noticed by students that ideography and its
attendant conventionalism continually appear in the pictographic histories
mentioned. The original authors had not advanced very far in
art, but they had not lost the thought-language, which preceded art.</p>

<p>The subject is here divided into: (1) Record of expedition; (2) Record
of battle; (3) Record of migration; (4) Record of sociologic events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page552" id="page552">[552]</a></span></p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">RECORD OF EXPEDITION.</span></h3>

<p>The following account from Lafitau (<i>a</i>) explains the device for prisoner,
under the heading of marked sticks, in Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span>, section <a href="#page227">2</a>,
supra:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The most grievous time for them is at night; for every evening they are extended
on their backs almost naked, with no other bed than the earth, in which four stakes
are driven for each prisoner; to these their arms and legs are attached, spread apart
in the form of a St. Andrew’s cross. To a fifth stake a halter is tied, which holds
the prisoner by the neck and is wound around it three or four times. Finally, he is
bound around the middle of the body by another halter or girdle, the two ends of
which are taken by the person in charge of the captive and placed under his head
while he sleeps, so that he will be awakened if the prisoner makes any movement
to escape.</p></div>

<p>With the same object of explaining pictographic devices, the following
is extracted from James’s Long (<i>h</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Returning war parties of the Omaha peel off a portion of the bark from a tree, and
on the trunk thus denuded and rendered conspicuous, they delineate hieroglyphics
with vermilion or charcoal, indicative of the success or misfortune of the party, in
their proceedings against the enemy. These hieroglyphics are rudely drawn, but
are sufficiently significant to convey the requisite intelligence [t]o another division of
the party, that may succeed them. On this rude chart the combatants are generally
represented by small straight lines, each surmounted by a head-like termination,
and are readily distinguishable from each other; the arms and legs are also represented
when necessary to record the performance of some particular act or to exhibit
a wound. Wounds are indicated by the representation of the dropping of blood
from the part; an arrow wound, by adding a line for the arrow, from which the
Indian is able to estimate with some accuracy its direction, and the depth to which
it entered. The killed are represented by prostrate lines; equestrians are also particularized,
and if wounded or killed they are seen to spout blood or to be in the act
of falling from their horses. Prisoners are denoted by their being led, and the number
of captured horses is made known by the number of lunules representing their
track. The number of guns taken may be ascertained by bent lines, on the angle of
which is something like the prominences of the lock. Women are portrayed with
short petticoats and prominent breasts, and unmarried females by the short queues
at the ears.</p></div>

<p>In Margry (<i>e</i>) there is an account of La Salle’s finding in 1683 on the
bark of a tree a record of the party of Tonty’s pilot. The picture was
that of a man with the costumes and general appearance of the pilot who
had deserted, another man tied as a captive, and four scalps. This corresponded
with the facts afterwards learned. The pilot had been left
free, another man kept alive, and four killed, thus accounting for the
lost party of six. The record had been made by the captors.</p>

<p>The figures in the following group, taken from several of the Winter
Counts of the Dakotas, picture a number of important expeditions, all
of which are independently known. Some of them are narrated in the
official documents of the United States.</p>

white man holding up three fingers is Gen.
Mackenzie, who, as was explained by the interpreter,
is placed upon the head of the Dakota to
indicate that the Dakotas backed or assisted him, but it may mean that
he commanded or was at the head of the party. The other white man
is Gen. Crook, or Three Stars, as indicated by the three stars above
him, and as he is called in another record. This designation might be
suggested from the uniform, but it is not accurate. Gen. Crook’s rank
as major-general of volunteers, or as brevet major-general in the Army,
did not entitle him to more than two stars on his shoulder straps. It is
possible that one of the stars in this figure belongs to Gen. Mackenzie.</p>

<p>This and the preceding figure are signs of a specially interesting expedition,
a condensed account of which follows taken from the annual
report of J. C. Calhoun, Secretary of War, November 29, 1823:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Gen. William H. Ashley, a licensed trader, was treacherously attacked by the
Arickaras at their village on the west bank of the Missouri river, about midway between
the present Fort Sully and Fort Rice. Twenty-three of the trading party
were killed and wounded, and the remainder retreated in boats and sent appeals for
succor to the commanding officer at Fort Atkinson, the present site of Council Bluffs.
This officer was Col. H. Leavenworth, Sixth United States Infantry, who marched
June 22, with 220 men of that regiment, 80 men of trading companies, and two
6-pound cannon, a 5&frac12;-inch brass howitzer, and some small swivels, nearly 700 miles
through a country filled with hostile or unreliable Indians, to the Ree villages,
which he reached on the 9th of August. The Dakotas were at war with the Arickara
or Rees, and 700 to 800 of their warriors had joined the United States forces on the
way; of these Dakotas 500 are mentioned as Yanktons, but the tribes of the remainder
are not designated. The Rees were in two villages, the lower one containing seventy-one
dirt lodges and the upper seventy, both being inclosed with palisades and a
ditch and the greater part of the lodges having a ditch around the bottom on
the inside. The enemy, having knowledge of the expedition, had fortified and made
every preparation for resistance. Their force consisted of over 700 warriors, most
of whom were armed with rifles procured from British traders. On the 9th of August
the Dakotas commenced the attack and were driven back until the regular
troops advanced, but nothing decisive resulted until the artillery was employed on
the 10th, when a large number of the Rees, including their chief, Gray Eyes, were
killed, and early in the afternoon the survivors begged for peace. They were much
terrified and humbled by the effect of the cannon, which, though small, answered the
purpose. During the main engagement the Dakotas occupied themselves in gathering
and carrying off all the corn to be found.</p></div>

<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">RECORD OF BATTLE.</span></h3>

<p>Lafitau (<i>b</i>) gives the following account, translated with condensation,
of the records of expedition, battle, etc., made by the Iroquois and
northeastern Algonquins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The designs which the Indians have tattooed on their faces and bodies are employed
as hieroglyphics, writing, and records. When an Indian returns from war and
wishes to make his victory known to the neighboring nations through whose country
he passes, when he has chosen a hunting ground and wishes it to be known that he
has selected it for himself and that it would be an affront to him for others to establish
themselves there, he supplies the lack of an alphabet by those characteristic
symbols which distinguish him personally; he paints on a piece of bark, which is
raised on a pole by a place of passage [trail], or he cuts away some pieces from a
tree trunk with his hatchet, and, after having made a smooth surface, traces his
portrait and adds other characters, which give all the information that he desires to
convey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page555" id="page555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>When I say that he draws his portrait, it will be understood that he is not skillful
enough to delineate all the features of his face in such a manner that it would be
recognized. They have, indeed, no other way of painting than that monogrammatic
or linear painting, which consists of little more than the mere outlines of the shadow
of the body rather than of the body itself&mdash;a picture so imperfect that it was often
necessary to add below the name of the object which was intended to be represented
in order to make it known.</p>

<p>The Indian then, to represent his portrait, draws a simple outline in the form of a
head, adding scarcely any marks to indicate the eyes, nose, ears, or other features
of the face. In place of these he draws the designs which are tattoed upon his own
face, as well as those upon his breast, and which are peculiar to him and render him
recognizable not only to those who have seen him, but even to all who, knowing
him only by reputation, are acquainted with his hieroglyphic symbol, as formerly
in Europe an individual was distinguished by his device and as we to-day know a
family by its armorial bearings. About his head he paints the object which expresses
his name; the Indian, for example, called the Sun paints a sun; at the right
he traces the animals which are the symbols of the nation and family to which he
belongs. That of the nation is above the one representing the family, and the beak
or muzzle of the former is so placed that it corresponds to the place of his right ear,
as if this symbolic figure of his nation represented its spirit, which inspires him. If
this Indian is returning from war, he represents beneath his portrait the number of
warriors composing the party which he leads, and beneath the warriors the number
of prisoners made and those whom he has killed by his own hand. At the left side
are indicated his expeditions and the prisoners or scalps taken by those of his party.
The warriors are represented with their weapons or simply by lines; the prisoners
by the stick decorated with feathers and by the chichikoue or tortoise-shell rattle,
which are the marks of their slavery; the scalps or the dead by the figures of men,
women, or children without heads. The number of expeditions is designated by
mats. He distinguishes those which he has accompanied from those which he has
commanded by adding strings [of wampum] to the latter. If the Indian goes as an
ambassador of peace all the symbols are of a pacific nature. He is represented below
his portrait with the calumet in his hand; at the left is seen an enlarged figure
of the calumet, the symbolic figure of the nation with which he goes to treat, and
the number of those who accompany him on the embassy.</p></div>

<p>The same author, on page 194 of the same volume, explains how the
mat or mattress came to mean war:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Iroquois and the Hurons call war n’ondoutagette and gaskenrhagette. The
final verb gagetton, which is found in the composition of these two words, and which
signifies to bear or to carry, shows, verily, that heretofore something was borne to
it [i. e., to war], which was a symbol of it [i. e., of war] to such a degree that it
[war] had assumed its [the symbol’s] designation. The term ondouta signifies the
down [the wool-like substance] which is taken from the ear [cat-tails] of marsh
reeds, and it also denotes the entire plant, which they use in making the mattresses
[nattes] upon which they lie; so that it appears that they applied this term to war
because every warrior in this kind of expeditions carried with him his own mattress;
in fact, the mattress is still to-day the symbol employed in their hieroglyphic picture-writing
to denote the number of their campaigns.</p></div>

<p>Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, in Science, April 1, 1892, has gone deeper into
the etymology of the words quoted, but coincides generally with Father
Lafitau in the explanation that they were denotive of the custom of the
Iroquoian warrior to carry his mattress when on the warpath.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 784.</span>&mdash;Battle of 1797. Ojibwa.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A historical record relating to a fight between the Ojibwa and the
Dakota ninety-one years ago is given in Fig. 784. The following narrative
was given by the draftsman of the record, an Ojibwa:</p>

<p>Ninety-one winters ago (A. D. 1797) twenty-five Ojibwa were encamped
on a small lake, <i>o</i>, called Zi'zabe'gamik, just west of Mille Lacs,
Minnesota. The chief’s lodge, <i>a</i>, was erected a short distance from the
lake, <i>m</i>, where the Indians had been hunting, and as he felt unsafe on
account of the hostile Sioux he directed some of his warriors to reconnoiter
south of the lower lake, where they soon discovered a body of
three hundred of their enemies. The chief of the reconnoitering party,
<i>b</i>, sent back word for the women and children to be removed to a place
of safety, but three of the old women refused to go. Their lodges are
represented in <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>e</i>. Five Ojibwa escaped through the brush, in
a northwest direction (indicated in <i>f</i>).</p>

<p>The Sioux surrounded the lake and the fight took place on the ice.
Twenty of the Ojibwa were killed, the last to die being the chief of the
party, who, from appearances, was beaten to death with a tomahawk;
<i>g</i> represents three bearskins; <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, and <i>j</i>, respectively, deer, grouse, and
turtle, the kinds of game hunted there during the several seasons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page557" id="page557">[557]</a></span>
The canoe <i>k</i> indicates the manner of hunting along the shore and the
stream connecting the lakes, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, and <i>o</i>.</p>

<p>The Ojibwa frequently spent part of a season at the middle lake, <i>m</i>,
and at another time had been engaged in a skirmish with the Sioux
farther north, on the small lake indicated at <i>o</i>. The Ojibwa had been
scattered about, but when the attack was made by the Sioux the former
rapidly came to the rescue both by boat, <i>p</i>, and on foot, <i>q</i>, so that the
enemy was gradually driven off.
In the first mentioned battle 70 Sioux were killed, their bodies being
subsequently buried in the lake by cutting holes through the ice. The
openings are shown at <i>r</i>, the lines representing bodies ready to be cast
down into the water.</p>

<p>Baron Lahontan (<i>b</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When a Party of (Algonkin) Savages have routed their enemies in any Place whatsoever,
the Conquerors take care to pull the Bark off the Trees for the height of five
or six Foot in all Places where they stop in returning to their own Country; and in
honour of their Victory paint certain images with Coal pounded and beat up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page558" id="page558">[558]</a></span>
Fat and Oyl. These Pictures continue upon the peel’d Tree for ten or twelve Years,
as if they were Grav’d, without being defac’d by the Rain.</p></div>

<p>The same author, on page 86, <i>et seq.</i>, of the same volume, gives an illustration,
with descriptive explanation, of a pictographic record supposed
to be made by the Canadian Algonquins. The explanation is useful as
indicating the principles of pictography adopted by the North American
Indians for a record of that character, but it is not deemed proper
to reproduce the illustration here. It has often been copied, but it is
misleading in its artistic details. It is obviously drawn by a European
artist as his own interpretation of a verbal description of the record.</p>

<p>The more valuable parts of the explanation are condensed as follows,
the quaint literation of the early translation being retained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Arms of France, with an Ax above. Now the Ax is a Symbol of War among
the Savages as the Calumet is the Bond of Peace: So that this imports that the
French have taken up the Ax, or have made a Warlike Expedition with as many
tens of Men as there are Marks or Points Round the Figure. These marks are eighteen
in number and so they signifie an Hundred and eighty Warriors.</p>

<p>A Mountain that represents the City of Monreal and the Fowl upon the Wing at
the top signifies Departure. The Moon upon the Back of the Stag signifies the first
Quarter of the July Moon which is call’d the Stag-Moon.</p>

<p>A Canow, importing that they have travel’d by Water as many Days as you see
Huts in the Figure, i. e., 21 Days [the huts undoubtedly mean stopping places for
night shelters].</p>

<p>A foot, importing that after their Voyage by Water they march’d on Foot as many
Days as there are Huts design’d; that is, seven Days Journeys for Warriors, each
Days Journey being as much as five common French Leagues, or five of those which
are reckon’d to be twenty in a Degree.</p>

<p>A Hand and three Huts, which signifie that they are got within three Days
Journey of the Iroquese Tsonnontouans [Senecas], whose Arms are a Hut with two
trees leaning downwards, as you see them drawn. The Sun imports that they were
just to the Eastward of the Village.</p>

<p>Twelve marks, signifying so many times ten Men like those last mentioned. The
Hut with two Trees being the Arms of the Tsonnontouans, shows that they were of
that Nation; and the Man in a lying posture speaks that they were surpris’d.</p>

<p>In this row there appears a Club and eleven Heads, importing that they had kill’d
eleven Tsonnontouans, and the five men standing upright upon the five Marks signifie
that they took as many times ten prisoners of War.</p>

<p>Nine Heads in an Arch [i. e., Bow] the meaning of which is, that nine of the
Aggressors or of the Victorious side were kill’d; and the twelve Marks underneath
signifie that as many were Wounded.</p>

<p>Arrows flying in the air, some to one side and some to the other, importing a
vigorous Defence on both sides.</p>

<p>The arrows all point one way, which speaks the worsted Party either flying or
fighting upon a Retreat in disorder.</p></div>

<p>The meaning of the whole is: A hundred and eighty French soldiers
set out from Montreal in the first quarter of the month of July and
sailed twenty-one days; after which they marched 35 leagues over land
and surprised 120 Senecas on the east side of their village, 11 of whom
were killed and 50 taken prisoners; the French sustaining the loss of
9 killed and 12 wounded, after a very obstinate engagement.</p>

<p>Fig. 787 is the pictorial story of Megaque’s last battle, drawn on birch
bark by the Passamaquoddy chief, Sapiel Selmo, with his interpreted
description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page561" id="page561">[561]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the old times there was a certain Indian chief and hunter. He was so cruel
and brave in time of war and his success in conquering his enemies and taking so
many scalps was so great that he was called Megaque, or the Scalping Man. In hunting
seasons he always went to his hunting grounds with his warriors to defend and
guard their hunting grounds from the trespassing of other hunters. He was well
known by other Indians for his bravery and his cruelty to his prisoners. He conquered
so many other warriors and tortured them that he was hated, and they tried
to capture him alive. Some of the warriors from other tribes gathered an army and
marched to his hunting grounds when they knew that he could not escape from their
hands. When they come near where he is they send messengers to him and notify
him of the approaching army; he is out hunting when they reach his camp, but they
make marks on a piece of birch bark, a figure of an Indian warrior with tomahawk
in one hand and spear in the other, similar to that seen in <i>g</i>, which is put up in a
village of wigwams, <i>i</i>. When Megaque returned from his hunt and found someone
had visited him during his absence, he also found the pieces of bark which read to
mean a band of warriors. He has no time. He was so brave and proud he did not
try to escape. In a day or two the band of warriors had reached him. After fighting,
when he killed many as usual, he was finally captured and taken to the enemy’s
country to be tortured. He can stand all the usual tortures bravely and sing his
usual war songs while he is tormented. Finally he was killed.</p>

<p>The following is the explanation of the details: <i>a</i>, Megaque; <i>b</i>, his braves; <i>c</i>, the
course by which the enemy comes; <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, Megaque’s rivers and lakes; <i>g</i>, the enemy;

<h4>THE BATTLE OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN.</h4>

<p>Dr. Charles E. McChesney, acting assistant surgeon, U. S. Army, has
communicated a most valuable and unique account, both in carefully
noted gesture-signs and in pictographs, of the battle, now much discussed,
which was fought in Montana on June 25, 1876, and is popularly
but foolishly styled “Custer’s massacre.” If the intended surprise,
with the object of killing as many Indians as possible, had been successful
instead of being a disastrous defeat, any surviving Indians
might with some propriety have spoken of “Custer’s massacre.” The
account now presented in one of its forms, was given by Red-Horse,
a Sioux chief and a prominent actor in the battle. The form which gives
the relation in gesture-signs and shows the syntax of the sign-language
perhaps better than any published narrative, will be inserted in
a work now in preparation by the present writer to be issued by the
Bureau of Ethnology. The narrative, closely translated into simple
English, is given below. Accompanying the record of signs are forty-one
sheets of manila paper, besides one map of the battle ground, all
drawn by Red-Horse, which average 24 by 26 inches, most of them
being colored. These may either be considered as illustrations of the
signs or the signs may be considered as descriptive of the pictographs.
It is impossible to reproduce now this mass of drawing on any scale
which would not be too minute for appreciation. It has been decided
to present, with necessary reduction from the above-mentioned dimensions,
the map and nine of the typical sheets in Pls. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXIX</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">XLVIII</span>.
Indeed, without considering the space required, there would be small
advantage in reproducing all of the sheets, as they are made objectionable
by monotonous repetitions.</p>

<p>Five springs ago I, with many Sioux Indians, took down and packed up our tipis
and moved from Cheyenne river to the Rosebud river, where we camped a few days;
then took down and packed up our lodges and moved to the Little Bighorn river
and pitched our lodges with the large camp of Sioux.</p>

<p>The Sioux were camped on the Little Bighorn river as follows: The lodges of the
Uncpapas were pitched highest up the river under a bluff. The Santee lodges were
pitched next. The Oglala’s lodges were pitched next. The Brulé lodges were
pitched next. The Minneconjou lodges were pitched next. The Sans Arcs’ lodges
were pitched next. The Blackfeet lodges were pitched next. The Cheyenne lodges
were pitched next. A few Arikara Indians were among the Sioux (being without
lodges of their own). Two-Kettles, among the other Sioux (without lodges). [Pl.

<p>I was a Sioux chief in the council lodge. My lodge was pitched in the center of
the camp. The day of the attack I and four women were a short distance from the
camp digging wild turnips. Suddenly one of the women attracted my attention to
a cloud of dust rising a short distance from camp. I soon saw that the soldiers were
charging the camp. [Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XLI</span> shows the soldiers charging the Indian camp.] To
the camp I and the women ran. When I arrived a person told me to hurry to the
council lodge. The soldiers charged so quickly we could not talk (council). We
came out of the council lodge and talked in all directions. The Sioux mount horses,
take guns, and go fight the soldiers. Women and children mount horses and go,
meaning to get out of the way.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the soldiers was an officer who rode a horse with four white feet. [From
Dr. McChesney’s memoranda this officer was Capt. French, Seventh Cavalry.] The
Sioux have for a long time fought many brave men of different people, but the Sioux
say this officer was the bravest man they had ever fought. I don’t know whether
this was Gen. Custer or not. Many of the Sioux men that I hear talking tell me it
was. I saw this officer in the fight many times, but did not see his body. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page565" id="page565">[565]</a></span>
been told me that he was killed by a Santee Indian, who took his horse. This officer
wore a large-brimmed hat and a deerskin coat. This officer saved the lives of
many soldiers by turning his horse and covering the retreat. Sioux say this officer
was the bravest man they ever fought. I saw two officers looking alike, both having
long yellowish hair.</p>

<p>Before the attack the Sioux were camped on the Rosebud river. Sioux moved
down a river running into the Little Bighorn river, crossed the Little Bighorn
river, and camped on its west bank.</p>

<p>This day [day of attack] a Sioux man started to go to Red Cloud agency, but when
he had gone a short distance from camp he saw a cloud of dust rising and turned
back and said he thought a herd of buffalo was coming near the village.</p>

<p>The day was hot. In a short time the soldiers charged the camp. [This was Maj.
Reno’s battalion of the Seventh Cavalry.] The soldiers came on the trail made by
the Sioux camp in moving, and crossed the Little Bighorn river above where the
Sioux crossed, and attacked the lodges of the Uncpapas, farthest up the river. The
women and children ran down the Little Bighorn river a short distance into a
ravine. The soldiers set fire to the lodges. All the Sioux now charged the soldiers
[Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XLII</span>] and drove them in confusion across the Little Bighorn river, which was
very rapid, and several soldiers were drowned in it. On a hill the soldiers stopped
and the Sioux surrounded them. A Sioux man came and said that a different party
of soldiers had all the women and children prisoners. Like a whirlwind the word
went around, and the Sioux all heard it and left the soldiers on the hill and went
quickly to save the women and children.</p>

<p>From the hill that the soldiers were on to the place where the different soldiers
[by this term Red-Horse always means the battalion immediately commanded by
General Custer, his mode of distinction being that they were a different body from
that first encountered] were seen was level ground with the exception of a creek.
Sioux thought the soldiers on the hill [i. e., Reno’s battalion] would charge them in
rear, but when they did not the Sioux thought the soldiers on the hill were out of
cartridges. As soon as we had killed all the different soldiers [Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">XLIII</span> shows the
fighting with Custer’s battalion] the Sioux all went back to kill the soldiers on the
hill. All the Sioux watched around the hill on which were the soldiers until a Sioux
man came and said many walking soldiers were coming near. The coming of the
walking soldiers was the saving of the soldiers on the hill. Sioux can not fight the
walking soldiers [infantry], being afraid of them, so the Sioux hurriedly left.</p>

</div>

<p>The soldiers charged the Sioux camp about noon. The soldiers were divided, one
party charging right into the camp. After driving these soldiers across the river,
the Sioux charged the different soldiers [i. e., Custer’s] below, and drove them in
confusion; these soldiers became foolish, many throwing away their guns and raising
their hands, saying, “Sioux, pity us; take us prisoners.” The Sioux did not take a
single soldier prisoner, but killed all of them; none were left alive for even a few
minutes. These different soldiers discharged their guns but little. I took a gun
and two belts off two dead soldiers; out of one belt two cartridges were gone, out
of the other five.</p>

<p>The Sioux took the guns and cartridges off the dead soldiers and went to the hill
on which the soldiers were, surrounded and fought them with the guns and cartridges
of the dead soldiers. Had the soldiers not divided I think they would have killed
many Sioux. The different soldiers [i. e., Custer’s battalion] that the Sioux killed
made five brave stands. Once the Sioux charged right in the midst of the different
soldiers and scattered them all, fighting among the soldiers hand to hand.</p>

the Sioux fell back, and the Sioux and the soldiers stood facing each other. Then
all the Sioux became brave and charged the soldiers. The Sioux went but a short
distance before they separated and surrounded the soldiers. I could see the officers
riding in front of the soldiers and hear them shouting. Now the Sioux had many<span class="pagenum"><a name="page566" id="page566">[566]</a></span>
killed. [Pls. <span class="smcap lowercase">XLIV</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">XLV</span> show the dead Sioux.] The soldiers killed 136 and

<p>The soldiers charged the Sioux camp farthest up the river. A short time after the
different soldiers charged the village below. While the different soldiers and Sioux
were fighting together the Sioux chief said, “Sioux men, go watch the soldiers on the
hill and prevent their joining the different soldiers.” The
Sioux men took the clothing off the dead and dressed themselves
in it. Among the soldiers were white men who were
not soldiers. The Sioux dressed in the soldiers’ and white
men’s clothing fought the soldiers on the hill.</p>

<p>The banks of the Little Bighorn river were high, and
the Sioux killed many of the soldiers while crossing. The
soldiers on the hill dug up the ground [i. e., made earthworks],
and the soldiers and Sioux fought at long range,
sometimes the Sioux charging close up. The fight continued
at long range until a Sioux man saw the walking soldiers
coming. When the walking soldiers came near the
Sioux became afraid and ran away. [Pls. <span class="smcap lowercase">XLVII</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">XLVIII</span>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 796.</span>&mdash;Record of Ojibwa
migration.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 796 is a pictorial account of the migrations
of the Ojibwa, being a reduced copy of a drawing
made by Sika'ssigĕ'. The account, especially in
its commencement, follows the rule of all ancient
history in being mixed with religion and myth.
The otter was the messenger of Mi'nabō'zho and
led the Âni'shinabē'g, who were the old or original
people, the ancestors of the Ojibwa, and also of
some other tribes which they knew, from an island,
which was the imagined center of the world as
bounded by the visible horizon, to the last seats
of the tribe before interference by Europeans.
The details of the figure were thus explained by
the draftsman:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>a.</i> The circle signifies the earth’s surface, bounded by
the horizon, as before described, and the dot in the center
is the imagined island or original home of the human
race. <i>b.</i> A line separating the history of the Midē'wiwin,
that is, the strictly religious tradition from that of the
actual migration as follows: When the Otter had offered
four prayers, which fact is referred to by the spot <i>c</i>, he disappeared
beneath the surface of the water and went toward
the west, in which direction the Âni'shinabég followed
him, and located at Ottawa island, <i>d</i>. Here they
erected the Midē'wigân and lived for many years. Then the Otter again disappeared
beneath the water, and it a short time reappeared at A'wiat'ang (<i>e</i>), when the Midē'wiwin
was again erected and the sacred rites conducted in accordance with the teachings<span class="pagenum"><a name="page567" id="page567">[567]</a></span>
of Mi'nabō'zho. Afterwards an interrupted migration was continued, the several
resting places being given below in their proper order, and at each of them the rites
of the Midē'wiwin were conducted in all their purity. The next place to locate at
was Mi'shenama'kinagung&mdash;Mackinaw (<i>f</i>); then Ne'mikung (<i>g</i>); Kiwe'winang' (<i>h</i>);
Bâ'wating&mdash;Sault Ste. Marie (<i>i</i>); Tshiwi'towi' (<i>j</i>); Nega'wadjĕ'ŭ&mdash;Sand mountain
(<i>k</i>), northern shore of Lake Superior; Mi'nisa'wik [Mi'nisa'bikkăng]&mdash;Island of
Rocks (<i>l</i>); Kawa'sitshĭŭwongk'&mdash;Foaming rapids (<i>m</i>); Mush'kisi'wi [Mash'kisi'bi]&mdash;Bad
river (<i>n</i>); Sha'gawâ'mikongk&mdash;“Long sand bar beneath the surface” (<i>o</i>);
Wikwe'dâ<sup>n</sup>wong'ga<sup>n</sup>&mdash;Sandy bay (<i>p</i>); Neâ'shiwĭkongk'&mdash;Cliff point (<i>q</i>); Neta-wa-ya-sink&mdash;Little
point of sand bar (<i>r</i>); Â<sup>n</sup>'nibis&mdash;Little elm tree (<i>s</i>); Wikup'bi<sup>n</sup>-mi<sup>n</sup>sh&mdash;Little
island basswood (<i>t</i>); Makubi<sup>n</sup>'-mi<sup>n</sup>sh&mdash;Bear island (<i>u</i>); Shage'skike'-dawan'ga

[Sa'apakwe'shkwa'okongk]&mdash;The place where lodge-bark is obtained (<i>x</i>);
Ne'uwesak'kudĕze'bi [Ne'wisak'udĕsi'bi]&mdash;Point dead wood timber river (<i>y</i>);
A<sup>n</sup>ibi'kanzi'bĭ [modern name Ashkiba'gisi'bĭ] rendered by different authorities both
as Fish Spawn river, and “Green Leaf river” (<i>z</i>).</p>

<p>This locality is described as being at Sandy lake, Minnesota, where the Otter
appeared for the last time, and where the Midē'wigân was finally established. The
Ojibwa say that they have dispersed in bands from La Pointe, as well as from
Sandy lake, over various portions of Minnesota and into Wisconsin, which final
separation into distinct bodies has been the chief cause of the gradual changes
found to exist in the ceremonies of the Midē'wiwin.</p></div>

in Kingsborough, Codex Boturini, being a facsimile of an original
Mexican hieroglyphic painting from the collection of Boturini, in twenty-three
plates.</p>

Dakota.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig 797.&mdash;The-people-were-burnt winter. Battiste Good’s Winter
Count 1762-’63. He explains the origin of the title
“Brulé” Dakota as follows:</p>

<p>Some of the Dakotas were living east of their
present country, when a prairie fire destroyed their
entire village. Many of their children and a man
and his wife, who were on foot some distance away
from the village, were burned to death. Many of
their horses were also burned to death. All the
people that could get to a long lake which was near
by saved themselves by jumping into it. Many of
these were badly burned about the thighs and legs, and this circumstance
gave rise to the name, si-can-gu, translated properly in to English
as Burnt Thigh and by the French abbreviated as Brulé, by which latter
name they have since been generally known.</p>

<p>This figure refers to the action of the military
authorities of the United States toward the
Indian tribes which had been connected with or
suspected of favoring the outbreak which resulted
in the defeat of the force under Gen. Custer.
A body of troops swept the reservations on the
Missouri river and took away all the ponies of
the tribes, thereby depriving them of their means
of transportation for hostile purposes. The hatted man with a star
above his head is the brigadier-general in command of the United
States forces. The hoof prints without marks of horseshoes indicate
the Indian ponies as usual. The black blurs among them probably
refer to the considerable number of the ponies that fell and died before
they reached Bismark and other points of sale to which they were
driven. It was promised that the amount realized from the sale of the
drove should be returned to the owners, but the latter received little.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="subhead">BIOGRAPHY.</span></h2>


<p>Pictographs under this head may be grouped as: 1st. Continuous
record of events in life. 2d. Particular exploits or events. Pictographs
of both of these descriptions are very common. An excellent collection
is published in the George Catlin Indian Gallery in the U. S. National
Museum, with memoir and statistics by Thomas Donaldson, a part of
the Smithsonian Report for 1885, Pls. 100 to 110.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">CONTINUOUS RECORD OF EVENTS IN LIFE.</span></h3>

<p>An authentic and distinct example of a continuous record is the following
“autobiography,” which was prepared at Grand River, Dakota,
in 1873, in a series of eleven drawings, by Running-Antelope, chief of
the Uncpapa Dakotas. Seven of these, regarded as of most interest,
are now presented. The sketches were painted in water colors and
were made for Dr. W. J. Hoffman, to whom the following interpretations
were given by the artist.</p>

<p>The record comprises the most important events in the life of Running-Antelope
as a warrior. Although frequently more than one person
is represented as slain, it is not to be inferred that all included in
the same figure were killed at one time unless it is so specified, but
that thus they were severally the victims of one expedition, of which
the warrior was a member or leader. The bird (<i>Falco cooperi?</i>) upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page572" id="page572">[572]</a></span>
shield always borne by him, refers to the clan or band totem, while the
antelope always drawn beneath the horses, in the act of running, identifies
his personal name.</p>

lance. This occurred in 1853.</p>

guns within the inclosure represent the five persons armed.</p>

<p>The Arikara are nearly always delineated in these pictures wearing
the topknot of hair, a fashion specially prevalent among the Absaroka,
though as the latter were the most inveterate enemies of the Sioux, and
as the word Palláni for Arikara is applied to all enemies, the Crow
custom may have been depicted as a generic mark.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It gives all the descriptive elements of the life of the deceased; in fact his biography.
He was a chieftain of royal blood (vide
the red planache with five double plumes).
He commanded an entire tribe. He had a
military command (<i>v.</i> the mace which he holds
in his right hand). He had taken part in
three battles (<i>v.</i> the three arms which three
times proved his strength). He was a judge
in his district (<i>v.</i> the sign of the speaking-trumpet
in the center). He had under him
four judges (<i>v.</i> the four signs of the speaking-trumpet
in the corners). He had during his
administration irrigated the country (<i>v.</i> the
designs which surround the painting); and he
had constructed great buildings (<i>v.</i> the checkers
surrounding the meanders). He had
busied himself besides all that in the raising
of cattle (<i>v.</i> the indications of llamas). He
had lived 42 years (<i>v.</i> the blocks, which indicate
years, just as the rings indicate the age
of trees). He had had five children, three sons and two daughters (indicated by
the little drops of sperm). Such is the life of this person, written by ideography on
a tablet, which at first would be taken as a fantasy of an infant painter.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page576" id="page576">[576]</a></span></p>

<p>From the same volume, page 9, the following extract is made, describing
Fig. 823:</p>

<p><i>c.</i> This arrow, which is broken, denotes that they were wounded in this expedition.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Thus they denote that the belts which they gave to raise a war party and to

<p>Fig. 824 is taken from the Winter Count of Battiste Good for the
year 1853-’54.</p>

<p>He calls the year Cross-Bear-died-on-the-hunt winter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 824.</span>&mdash;Cross-Bear’s death.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The character on the extreme left hand is a “travail,” and means
they moved; the buffalo, to hunt buffalo; the bear with
mouth open and paw advanced, cross-bear. The involute
character frequently repeated in Battiste’s record
signifies pain in the stomach and intestines, resulting
in death. In this group of characters there is not only
the brief story, an obituary notice, but an ideographic
mark for a particular kind of death, a noticeable name-totem,
and a presentation of the Siouan mode of transportation.</p>

<p>The word “travail” may require explanation. It refers to the peculiar
sledge which is used by many tribes of Indians for the purpose of
transportation. It is used on the surface of the ground when not covered
with snow even more than when snow prevails. In print the
word is more generally found in the plural, where it is spelled “travaux”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page577" id="page577">[577]</a></span>
and sometimes “travois.” The etymology of this word has been
the subject of much discussion. It is probably one of the words which
descended in corrupted form from the language of the Canadian voyageurs,
and was originally the French word “traineau,” with its meaning
of sledge. The corrupt form “travail” was retained by English
speakers from its connection with the sound of the word “travel.”</p>

<p>Fig. 825 is taken from a roll of birch bark, known to be more than seventy
years old, obtained in 1882 from the Ojibwa Indians at Red Lake,
Minnesota. The interpretation was given by an Indian from that
reservation, although he did not know the author nor the history of
the record. With one exception, all of the characters were understood
and interpreted to Dr. Hoffman, in 1883, by Ottawa Indians at Harbor
Springs, Michigan.</p>

<p><i>a</i> represents the Indian who visited a country supposed to have been
near one of the great lakes. He has a scalp in his hand which he obtained
from the head of an enemy, after having killed him. The line

the line from the mouth to the same circle signifies (in the Dakota
method), “That is it,” having reference to proper names.</p>

<p><i>b</i>, the enemy killed. He was a man who held a position of some consequence
in his tribe, as is indicated by the horns, marks used by the
Ojibwas among themselves for shaman, wabeno, etc. It has been suggested
that the object held in the hand of this figure is a rattle, though
the Indians, to whom the record was submitted for examination, are in
doubt, the character being indistinct.</p>

three nights, i. e., three black suns. Three days from home was the
distance the Indian <i>a</i> traveled to reach the country for which he started.</p>

<p><i>d</i> represents a shell, and denotes the primary object of the journey.
Shells were needed for making ornaments and to trade, and traffic between
members of the different and even distant tribes was common,
although attended with danger.</p>

record and the beginning of another.</p>

<p>The following narrative of personal exploit was given to Dr. W. J.
Hoffman by “Pete,” a Shoshoni chief, during a visit of the latter to
Washington, in 1880. The sketch, Fig. 826, was drawn by the narrator,
who also gave the following explanation of the characters:</p>

at the left end, is shown the Sioux camp from
which the trail of the horse thieves extends to near
the camp of the Hidatsa, at Fort Berthold, North Dakota. This
village is indicated by the circular dirt lodges within a square
inclosure. The Sioux captured some Indian horses and rode away, as
indicated by the prints of horse hoofs. A series of short lines from the
Hidatsa village indicates that Lean-Wolf and his companions followed
on foot, subsequently overtaking the Sioux, killing one and taking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page582" id="page582">[582]</a></span>
scalp. The scalp is shown above the figure of the human head, while
the weapon with which he struck the Sioux is also shown. This is the

In the pursuit of the Sioux, who had come to Fort Berthold on another
occasion to steal horses, Lean-Wolf assisted in capturing and killing
three of the marauders. In the left-hand group of the three human

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<span class="subhead">IDEOGRAPHY.</span></h2>


<p>The imagination is stimulated and developed by the sense of sight
more than by any other sense, perhaps more than by all of the other
senses combined. The American Indians, and probably all savages,
are remarkable for acute and critical vision, and also for their retentive
memory of what they have once seen. When significance is once
attached to an object seen, it will always be recalled, though often with
false deductions. Therefore, like deaf-mutes, who depend mainly on
sight, the American Indians have developed great facility in communicating
by signs, and also in expressing their ideas in pictures
which are ideographic though seldom artistic. This tendency has
likewise affected their spoken languages. Their terms express with
wonderful particularity the characters and relations of visible objects,
and their speeches, which are in a high degree metaphoric, become so
by the figurative presentation in words of such objects accompanied
generally by imitative signs for them, and often by their bodily exhibition.</p>

<p>The statement once made that the aboriginal languages of North
America are not capable of expressing abstract ideas is incorrect,
but the tendency to use tangible and visible forms for such ideas is
apparent. This practice was most marked in reference to religious
subjects, which were often presented under the veil of symbols, as has
been the common expedient of most peoples who have emerged from
the very lowest known stages of human culture, but have not attained
the highest.</p>

<p>Many instances appear in this work in which pictures expressive
of an idea present more than mere portraitures of objects, which latter
method has been styled imitative or iconographic writing.</p>

<p>It is, however, impossible to classify with scientific precision the
pictured ideograms collected, for the reason that many of them occupy
intermediate points in any scheme that would be succinct enough to
be practically useful. In the arrangement of the present chapter the
division is made into: 1st. Abstract ideas expressed pictorially. 2d.
Signs, symbols, and emblems. 3d. Significance of colors. 4th. Gesture
and posture signs depicted. When any of the graphic representations
of ideas have become successful, i. e., commonly adopted, it soon becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page584" id="page584">[584]</a></span>
more or less conventionalized. Chapter <a href="#page649">XIX</a> is devoted specially to
that branch of the general subject.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">ABSTRACT IDEAS EXPRESSED PICTORIALLY.</span></h3>

<p>The first stage of picture-writing, as considered in the present chapter,
was the representation of a material object in such style or connection
as determined it not to be a mere portraiture of that object, but figurative
of some other object or person. This stage is abundantly exhibited
among the American Indians. Indeed, their personal and tribal names
thus objectively represented constitute the largest part of their picture-writing
so far thoroughly understood.</p>

<p>The second step was when a special quality or characteristic of an
object, generally an animal, became employed to express a general
quality, i. e., an abstract idea. It can be readily seen how, among the
Egyptians, a hawk with bright eye and lofty flight might be selected
to express divinity and royalty, and that the crocodile should denote
darkness, while a slightly further advance in metaphors made the ostrich
feather, from the equality of its filaments, typical of truth. All peoples
whose rulers used special objective designations of their rank, made
those objects the signs for power, whether they were crowns or umbrellas,
eagle feathers, or colored buttons. A horse meant swiftness,
a serpent life&mdash;or immortality when drawn as a circle&mdash;a dog was
watchfulness, and a rabbit was fecundity. It is evident from examples
given in the present paper that the American tribes at the time of the
Columbian discovery had entered upon this second step of picture-writing,
though with marked inequality between tribes and regions in
advance therein. None of them appear to have reached such proficiency
in the expression of connected ideas by picture, as is shown in the
sign-language existing among some of them, which may be accounted
for by its more frequent use required by the constant meeting of many
persons speaking different languages. There is no more necessary connection
between abstract ideas and sounds, the mere signs of thought
that strike the ear, than there is between the same ideas and signs addressed
only to the eye. The success and scope of either mode of
expression depends mainly upon the amount of its exercise, in which
oral language undoubtedly has surpassed both sign-language and picture-writing.</p>

<p>The examples now following in this chapter are by no means all the
graphic representations of abstract ideas collected. Indeed many
others are contained in the work under other headings, but the following
are selected for grouping here with an attempt at order. In the
popular definition, or want of definition, some of them would be classed
as symbols.</p>

<h5>DIRECTION.</h5>

<p>This title has been selected as being the most comprehensive one for
the five following figures. The first shows a moccasin with a serpentine
track, at the farthest end of which is an
angular design, indicating leadership as
well as the direction taken. This suggests
the leader of a war party conducting his
band over an uncertain trail. The second
is explanatory of the first. That the chief
goes in front is indicated in a manner the
reverse of that which would appear in the
designs common in our military text-books.
He is supposed to be in the opening in the
angle of the advance and not at its apex.
The third figure shows a steadfast leadership
in the determined straight direction of attack
against the enemy. This is still more ideographically
represented by the single strong straight line showing
that he “Don’t turn” in the fourth figure of this group.</p>

explains that six Dakotas on the
warpath had nearly perished with
hunger, when they found and ate
the rotting carcass of an old buffalo, on which the
wolves had been feeding. They were seized soon after
with pains in the stomach, their bellies swelled, and
gas poured from the mouth and the anus, and they
“died of a whistle,” or from eating a whistle. The
sound of gas escaping from the mouth is illustrated in the figure. The

<h5>FEAR.</h5>

<p>The following ideograms for the concept of fear show respectively
an elk, a bear, and a bull surrounded by a circle of hunters. It would
seem that the latter were supposed to be afraid to attack the animals
when at bay in hand-to-hand fight, but stood off in a circle until they
had killed the enraged beast, or at least wounded it sufficiently to
allow of approach without danger.</p>

represented with two waving lines passing
upward from the mouth in imitation of

passing two extended and separated fingers
(or all fingers separated) upward and forward
from the mouth. This gesture is

<p>Fig. 919.&mdash;General Maynadier made peace with the
Oglalas and Brulés. American-Horse’s Winter Count,
1865-’66. The general’s name (the sound of which
resembles the words “many deer”) is indicated by the
two deer heads connected with his mouth by lines. The
pictographers represented his name in the same manner
as they do their own. It is not an example of rebus,
but of misunderstanding the significance of the word
as spoken and heard by such Indians as had some
knowledge of English. The official interpreters would be likely to
commit the error as they seldom understand more than the colloquial
English phrases.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 920 is taken from the winter count of Battiste Good for the year
1841-’42. He calls the year “Pointer-made-a-commemoration-of-the-dead
winter.” Also “Deep-snow winter.”</p>

<p>The extended index denotes the man’s name,
“Pointer,” the circular line and spots, deep snow.</p>

<p>The spots denoting snow occur also in other portions
of this count, and the circle, denoting much, is
in Fig. <a href="#page294">260</a> connected with a forked
stick and incloses a buffalo head to
signify “much meat.” That the circle
is intended to signify much is made
probable, by the fact that a gesture for “much” is made
by passing the hands upward from both sides and together before the
body, describing the upper half of a circle, i. e., showing a heap.</p>

mark of identity, as if to suggest that the man was so
much obscured in the fog as not to be recognizable.</p>

<h5>OPPOSITION.</h5>

<p>The following two figures, 925 and 926, are introduced to show the
opposition in attitude, which would not be understood without knowledge
of the fact that these are perhaps the only instances in a collection
of nearly three hundred in which the characterizing faces are turned
to the right, all others being turned to the left. This shows the opposite
of normality, i. e., opposition, as suggested in each case, with a
different shade of meaning.</p>

<p>Those who have charge of the prisoners prepare them for this ceremony, which is
a sort of triumph, having for them something of glory and of sorrow at the same
time; for, whether it is desired to do them honor or to enhance the triumph of the
conquerors, they paint their faces black and red as on a solemn feast day. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page599" id="page599">[599]</a></span>
heads are decorated with a crown, embellished with feathers; in the left hand is
placed a white stick covered with swan skin, which is a sort of commander’s baton
or scepter, as if they represented the chief of the nation [sic] or the nation itself
which had been vanquished; in the right hand is placed the rattle, and around the
neck of the most prominent of the slaves the wampum necklace which the war chief
has given or received when he raised the party and on which the other warriors
have sealed their engagement. But if on one hand the prisoners are honored, on
the other, to make them feel their miserable situation, they are deprived of everything
else; so that they are left entirely naked and made to walk with the arms tied
behind the back above the elbow.</p></div>

<p>The expression prisoner and slave are often
convertible. The following from Kingsborough
(<i>f</i>), explaining this illustration reproduced as
Fig. 937, refers in terms to slavery. “The figures
are those of the wife and son of a cacique who
rebelled against Montezuma, and who, having
been conquered, was strangled. The ‘collars’
upon their necks show that they have been
reduced to slavery.”</p>

This figure is explained by the one preceding. Only

emerging through some orifice. Heads and other
parts of animals are frequently portrayed as signifying
the whole, by synechdoche, but in this case the presentation

by comparison of the standing buffalo with the

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 956.</span>&mdash;Trade.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 956 is taken from Prince Maximilian, of Wied’s
(<i>h</i>) Travels. The cross signifies, I will barter or trade.
Three animals are drawn on the right hand of the cross;
one is a buffalo (probably albino); the two others, a
weasel (<i>Mustela Canadensis</i>) and an otter. The pictographer
offers in exchange for the skins of these animals
the articles which he has drawn on the left side of the cross. He has
there, in the first
place, depicted a
beaver very plainly,
behind which
there is a gun;
to the left of the
beaver are thirty
strokes, each ten
separated by a
longer line; this
means: I will give
thirty beaver
skins and a gun for the skins of the three animals on the right hand of
the cross.</p>

<p>The ideographic character of the design consists in the use of the
cross&mdash;being a drawing of the gesture-sign for “trade”&mdash;the arms being
interchanged in position. Of the two things each one is put in the
place before occupied by the other thing, the idea of exchange.</p>

<h5>UNION.</h5>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 965.</span>&mdash;Whirlwind.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a decoration of great frequency and
consisting of the single and double spirals.
The single spiral is the symbol of Ho-bo-bo,
the twister, who manifests his power by
the whirlwind. It is also of frequent occurrence
as a rock etching in the vicinity of ruins, where also the symbol of the Ho-bo-bo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page605" id="page605">[605]</a></span>
is seen. But the figure does not appear upon any of the pottery. The myth explains
that a stranger came among the people, when a great whirlwind blew all
the vegetation from the surface of the earth and all the water from its courses. With
a flint he caught these symbols upon a rock, the etching of which is now in Keam’s
Cañon, Arizona Territory. It is 17 inches long and 8 inches across. He told them
that he was the keeper of breath. The whirlwind and the air which men breathe
comes from this keeper’s mouth.</p></div>

without arms are also without weapons. Those of the second stage carry at the
height of the belt a kind of hatchet and those of the upper platform have each a club.</p>

<p>Considering the character of the locality where this cloth was found, the number
of forts there, the marshy land which prevented dry-shod communication between
them, it can not be doubted that the subject matter was the representation of that
region, but this representation is not a drawing on a plan, but is a description which
does not only treat of the nature of the place and of the work that man raised there,
but it also indicates the rôle that the inhabitants played there.</p></div>

<p>The function of the men with exaggerated ears and no arms was that
of scouts. The armed men with normal ears were guards or warriors<span class="pagenum"><a name="page607" id="page607">[607]</a></span>
bearing different weapons, ax and club, and differently uniformed.
The highest figure with one large ear was the chief of the garrison.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the scouts have enormous feet which do not
rest on the ground. This in connection with their exaggerated ears
implies that their duty is to listen and when they hear the enemy not
to engage him, as they have no arms or weapons, but to fly to the headquarters
and make the report. The duty of the warriors is not to listen,
so their ears are not abnormal, but to fight, and therefore they have
arms, one of which is exposed and the other holds a weapon. Their
feet are attached to their several stations. The chief must both listen
and direct, wherefore he is drawn with one exaggerated ear and one
arm. His feet do not touch the platform, which signifies that he has
no special station, but must move wherever he is most needed.</p>

<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">SIGNS, SYMBOLS, AND EMBLEMS.</span></h3>

<p>The terms sign, symbol, and emblem are often used interchangeably
and therefore incorrectly. Many persons ascribe an occult and mystic
signification to symbols, probably from their general religious and
esoteric employment. All characters in Indian picture-writing have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page608" id="page608">[608]</a></span>
been loosely styled symbols, and, as there is no logical distinction
between the characters impressed with enduring form and when merely
outlined in the ambient air, all Indian gestures, motions, and attitudes,
intended to be significant, might with equal appropriateness be called
symbolic. But an Indian sign-talker or a deaf-mute represents a person
by mimicry, and an object by the outline of some striking part of its
form, or by the pantomime of some peculiarity in its actions or relations.
Their attempt is to bring to mind the person or thing through its
characteristics, not to distinguish the characteristics themselves, which
is a second step. In the same manner a simple pictorial sign attempts
to express an object, idea, or fact without any approach to symbolism.
Symbols are less obvious and more artificial than mere signs, are not
only abstract, but metaphysical, and often need explanation from
history, religion, and customs. They do not depict, but suggest subjects;
do not speak directly through the eye to the intelligence, but presuppose
in the mind knowledge of an event or fact which the sign
recalls. The symbols of the ark, dove, olive branch, and rainbow would
be wholly meaningless to people unfamiliar with the Mosaic or some
similar cosmology, as would the cross and the crescent be to those
ignorant of history.</p>

<p>The loose classification by which symbols would include every gesture
or pictorial sign that naturally or conventionally recalls a corresponding
idea, only recognizes the fact that every action and object
can, under some circumstances, become a symbol. And indeed lovers of
the symbolic live in, on, and by the symbols which they manufacture.</p>

<p>A curious instance of the successful manufacture of a symbol by the
ingenuity of one man is in the one now commonly pictured of a fish to
represent Christ. The fish for obvious reasons has been connected
with Eurasian mythology, and therefore was a heathen symbol many
centuries before the Christian era; indeed, probably before the creed
of the Israelites had become formulated. It was used metaphorically
or emblematically by the early Christians without the apparent propriety
of the lamb-bearing shepherd, the dove, and other emblems or
symbols found in the catacombs, and Didron (<i>b</i>) says that only in the
middle of the fourth century Optatus, bishop of Milesia, in Africa, declared
the significance of the letters of the Greek word for fish, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΙΧΘΥΣ</span>,
to be the initials of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς Θεοῦ Ὑιος Σωτηρ</span>, which acrostic was
received with acclamation, and new characteristics were from time to
time invented, adding force to the thenceforth commonly displayed
symbol. It may be noted that when symbols, which were generally
religious, received acceptance, they were soon used objectively as amulets
or talismans.</p>

<p>This chapter is not intended to be a treatise on symbolism, but it is
proper to mention the distinction in the writer’s mind between a pictorial
sign, an emblem, and a symbol; though it is not easy to preserve
accurate discrimination in classification of ideographic characters. To
partly express the distinction, nearly all of the characters in the Winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="page609" id="page609">[609]</a></span>
Counts in this work are regarded as pictorial signs, and the class
represented by tribal and clan designations, insignia, etc., is considered
to belong to the category of emblems. There is no doubt, however,
that true symbols exist among the Indians, as they must exist to some
extent among all peoples not devoid of poetic imagination. Some of
them are shown in this work. The pipe is generally a symbol of peace,
although in certain positions and connections it signifies preparation
for war, and, again, subsequent victory. The hatchet is a common symbol
for war, and joined hands or approaching palms denote peace.
The tortoise has been clearly used as a symbol for land, and many
other examples can be admitted. Apart from the exaggerations of
Schoolcraft, true symbolism is found among the Ojibwa, of which illustrations
are presented. The accounts of the Zuñi, Moki, and Navajo,
before mentioned, show the constant employment of symbolic devices
by those tribes which are notably devoted to mystic ceremonies.
Nevertheless the writer’s personal experience is that when he has at
first supposed a character to be a genuine symbol, better means of
understanding has often proved it to be not even an ideograph, but a
mere objective representation. In this connection the remarks on the
circle, in Lone-Dog’s Winter Count for 1811-’12, and those on the cross
infra, may be in point.</p>

<p>The connection, to the unlettered Indian, between printed words,
pictures, and signs, was well illustrated through the spontaneous copial,
by a Cheyenne, of the ornate labels on packages of sugar and coffee,
which he had seen at a reservation, and the lines of which he rather
skillfully and very ingeniously repeated on a piece of paper when sending
to a post-trader to purchase more of the articles. The printed
label was to him the pictorial sign for those articles.</p>

<p>The following remarks are quoted from D’Alviella (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a symbolism so natural, that, like certain implements peculiar to the stone
age, it does not belong to any particular race, but constitutes a characteristic trait
of mankind at a certain phase of its development. Of this class are representations
of the sun by a disk or radiating face, of the moon by a crescent, of the air by birds,
of water by fishes or a broken line, of thunder by an arrow or a club, etc. We
ought, perhaps, to add a few more complicated analogies, as those which lead to
symbolizing the different phases of human life by the growth of a tree, the generative
forces of nature by phallic emblems, the divine triads by an equilateral triangle,
or in general by any triple combination the members of which are equal, and the
four principal directions of space by a cross. How many theories have been built
upon the presence of the cross as an object of veneration among nearly all the peoples
of the Old and New Worlds? Roman Catholic writers have justly protested, in
recent years, against attributing a pagan origin to the cross of the Christians, because
there were cruciform signs in the symbolism of religions anterior to Christianity.
It is also right, by the same reason, to refuse to accept the attempts to seek
for infiltrations of Christianity in foreign religions because they also possess the
sign of redemption. * * * Nearly all peoples have represented the fire from the
sky by an arm and, sometimes also, by a bird of strong and rapid flight. It was
symbolized among the Chaldeans by a trident. Cylinders going back to the most
ancient ages of Chaldean art exhibit a water jet gushing from a trident which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page610" id="page610">[610]</a></span>
is held by the god of the sky or of the storm. The Assyrian artist who first, on the
bas-reliefs of Nimroud or Malthai, doubled the trident or transformed it into a trifid
fascicle, docile to the refinements and elegancies of classic art, by that means
secured for the ancient Mesopotamian symbol the advantage over all the other
representations of thunder with which it could compete. The Greeks, like the other
Indo-European nations, seem to have represented the storm-fire under the features
of a bird of prey. When they received the Asiatic figure of the thunderbolt, they
put it in the eagle’s claws and made of it the scepter of Zeus, explaining the combination,
after their habit, by the story of the eagles bringing thunder to Zeus when
he was preparing for the war against the Titans. Latin Italy transmitted the
thunderbolt to Gaul, where, in the last centuries of paganism, it alternated on the
Gallo-Roman monuments with the two-headed hammer.</p></div>

<p>The emblem writers, so designated, have furnished an immense body
of literature, and apparently have considered such pictures as those of
the Winter Counts in the present work and also all symbols to be included
in their proper scope. The best summary on the subject is by
Henry Greene (<i>a</i>), from which the following condensed extract is taken:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of the changes through which a word may pass the word emblem presents one
of the most remarkable instances. Its present signification, type, or allusive representation
is of comparatively modern use, while its original meaning is obsolete.
Among the Greeks an emblem meant something thrown in or inserted after the
fashion of what we now call marquetry and mosaic work, or in the form of a detached
ornament to be affixed to a pillar, a tablet, or a vase, and put off or on as
there might be occasion.</p>

<p>Quintilian (lib. 2, cap. 4), in enumerating the arts of oratory used by the pleaders
of his day, describes some of them as in the habit of preparing and committing
to memory certain highly finished clauses, to be inserted (as occasion might arise)
like emblems in the body of their orations. Such was the meaning of the term in
the classical ages of Greece and Rome; nor was its signification altered until some
time after the revival of literature in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Thus, in their origin, emblems were the figures or ornaments fashioned by the
tools of the artists, in metal or wood, independent of the vase, or the column, or the
furniture they were intended to adorn; they might be affixed or detached at the
promptings of the owner’s fancy. Then they were formed, as in mosaic, by placing
side by side little blocks of colored stone, or tiles, or small sections of variegated
wood. Raised or carved figures, however produced, came next to be considered as
emblems; and afterwards any kind of figured ornament or device, whether carved
or engraved or simply traced, on the walls and floors of houses or on vessels of wood,
clay, stone, or metal.</p>

<p>By a very easy and natural step figures and ornaments of many kinds, when
placed on smooth surfaces, were named emblems; and as these figures and ornaments
were very often symbolical, i. e., signs or tokens of a thought, a sentiment, a
saying, or an event, the term emblem was applied to any painting, drawing, or
print that was representative of an action, of a quality of the mind, or of any peculiarity
or attribute of character. Emblems in fact were and are a species of hieroglyphics,
in which the figures or pictures, besides denoting the natural objects to
which they bear resemblances, were employed to express properties of the mind,
virtues and abstract ideas, and all the operations of the soul.</p></div>

<p>The following remarks of the same author (<i>b</i>) are presented in this connection,
though they pass beyond the scope of either symbols or emblems
into other divisions of pictography, as classified in the present work:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Coins and medals furnish most valuable examples of emblematical figures; indeed
some of the emblem writers, as Sambucus, in 1564, were among the earliest to publish<span class="pagenum"><a name="page611" id="page611">[611]</a></span>
impressions or engravings of ancient Roman money, on which are frequently
given very interesting representations of customs and symbolical acts. On Grecian
coins we find, to use heraldic language, that the owl is the crest of Athens, a wolf’s
head that of Argos, and a tortoise the badge of the Peloponnesus. The whole history
of Louis XIV and that of his great adversary, William III, is represented in
volumes containing the medals that were struck to commemorate the leading events
of their reigns, and, though outrageously untrue to nature and reality by the
adoption of Roman costumes and classic symbols, they serve as records of remarkable
occurrences.</p>

<p>Heraldry throughout employs the language of emblems; it is the picture-history
of families, of tribes, and of nations, of princes and emperors. Many a legend and
many a strange fancy may be mixed up with it, and demand almost the credulity
of simplest childhood in order to obtain our credence; yet in the literature of chivalry
and honors there are enshrined abundant records of the glory that belonged
to mighty names.</p>

<p>The custom of taking a device or badge, if not a motto, is traced to the earliest
times of history. It is a point not to be doubted that the ancients used to bear
crests and ornaments in the helmets and on the shields; for we see this clearly in
Virgil, when he made the catalogue of the nations which came in favor of Turnus
against the Trojans, in the eighth book of the Æneid; Amphiaraus then (as Pindar
says), at the war of Thebes, bore a dragon on his shield. Similarly Statius writes
of Capaneus and of Polinices that the one bore the Hydra and the other the Sphynx.</p></div>

<p>Emblems do not necessarily require any analogy between the objects
representing and the objects or qualities represented, but may arise
from pure accident. They may bear any meaning that men may choose
to attach to them, so their value still more than that of symbols
depends upon extrinsic facts and not intrinsic features. After a scurrilous
jest the beggar’s wallet became the emblem of the confederated
nobles, the Gueux of the Netherlands; and a sling, in the early minority
of Louis XIV, was adopted from the refrain of a song by the Frondeur
opponents of Mazarin.</p>

<p>The several tribal designations for Sioux, Arapaho, Cheyenne,
etc., are their emblems, precisely as the star-spangled flag is that of
the United States, but there is no intrinsic symbolism in them. So
the designs for individuals, when not merely translations of their
names, are emblematic of their family totems or personal distinctions,
and are no more symbols than are the distinctive shoulder-straps of an
army officer.</p>

<p>The point urged is that while many signs can be used as emblems
and both can be converted by convention into symbols or be explained
as such by perverted ingenuity, it is futile to seek for that form of
psychological exuberance in the stage of development attained by the
greater part of the American tribes. All predetermination to interpret
their pictographs on the principles of symbolism as understood or pretended
to be understood by its admirers, and as are sometimes properly
applied not only to Egyptian hieroglyphics, but to Mexican, Maya, and
some other southern pictographs, results in mooning mysticism.</p>

<p>The following examples are presented as being either symbols or
emblems, according to the definition of those terms, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="page612" id="page612">[612]</a></span>
appropriate to this section. More will be found in Chapter <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page676">XX</a></span>, on
Special Comparisons, and indeed may appear under different headings;
e. g., Battiste Good symbolizes hunting by a buffalo head and arrow,
Fig. <a href="#page305">321</a>, and war by a special head-dress, Fig. <a href="#page321">395</a>.</p>

<p>Sir A. Mackenzie (<i>c</i>) narrates that in 1793 he found among the Athabascans
an emblem of a country abounding in animals. This was a small
round piece of green wood chewed at one end in the form of a brush,
which the Indians use to pick the marrow out of bones.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank H. Cushing, in notes not yet reduced to final shape for
publication, gives two excellent examples of symbols among the Zuñi:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) The circle or halo around the sun is supposed to be and is called by the Zuñi
the House of the Sun-God. This is explained by analogy. A man seeks shelter on
the approach of a rainstorm. As the sun circle almost invariably appears only with
the coming of a storm, the Sun, like his child, the man, seeks shelter in his house,
which the circle has thus come to be.</p>

<p>The influence of this simple inference myth on the folklore of the Zuñi shows itself
in the perpetuation, until within recent generations, of the round sun towers and
circular estufas so intimately associated with sun worship, yet which were at first
but survivals of the round medicine lodge.</p>

<p>(2) The rainbow is a deified animal having the attributes of a human being, yet
also the body and some of the functions of a measuring worm. Obviously, the
striped back and arched attitude of the measuring worm, its sudden appearance and
disappearance among the leaves of the plants which it inhabits, are the analogies
on which this personification is based. As the measuring worm consumes the
herbage of the plants and causes them to dry up, so the rainbow, which appears
only after rains, is supposed to cause a cessation of rains, consequently to be the
originator of droughts, under the influence of which latter plants parch and wither
away as they do under the ravages of the measuring worms. Here it will be seen
that the visible phenomenon called the rainbow gets by analogy the personality of
the measuring worm, while from the measuring worm in turn the rainbow gets its
functions as a god. Of this the cessation of rain on the appearance of the rainbow
is adduced as proof.</p></div>

<p>The following is reported by Dr. W. H. Dall (<i>e</i>), and explains how
the otter protruding his tongue is the emblem of Shaman:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The carvings on the rattles of the Tlinkit are matters belonging particularly to
the shaman or medicine man, and characteristic of his profession. Among these
very generally, if not invariably, the rattle is composed of the figure of a bird, from
which, near the head of the bird or carved upon the back of the bird’s head, is represented
a human face with the tongue protruding.</p>

<p>This tongue is bent downward and usually meets the mouth of a frog or an otter,
the tongue of either appearing continuous with that of the human face. In case it
is a frog it usually appears impaled upon the tongue of a kingfisher, whose head and
variegated plumage are represented near the handle in a conventional way. It is
asserted that this represents the medicine man absorbing from the frog, which has
been brought to him by the kingfisher, either poison or the power of producing evil
effects on other people.</p>

<p>In case it is an otter the tongue of the otter touches the tongue of the medicine
man, as represented on the carving. * * *</p>

<p>This carving is represented, not only on rattles, but on totem posts, fronts of
houses, and other objects associated with the medicine man, the myth being that
when the young aspirant for the position of medicine man goes out into the woods
after fasting for a considerable period, in order that his to be familiar spirit may<span class="pagenum"><a name="page613" id="page613">[613]</a></span>
seek him, and that he may become possessed of the power to communicate with
supernatural beings; if successful he meets with a river otter, which is a supernatural
animal. The otter approaches him and he seizes it, kills it with the blow
of a club, and takes out the tongue, after which he is able to understand the
language of all inanimate objects, of birds, animals, and other living creatures.
* * *</p>

<p>This ceremony or occurrence happens to every real medicine man. Consequently
the otter presenting his tongue is the most universal type of the profession as such,
and is sure to be found somewhere in the paraphernalia of every individual of that
profession.</p></div>

<p>With this account from the Pacific coast a similar determination of
emblems by the Indians in the northeastern parts of the United States
may be compared. The objects seen by them in their fasting visions
not only were decisive of their names but were held to show the course
of their lives. If a youth saw an eagle or bear he was destined to be
a warrior; if a deer he would be a man of peace; and a turkey buzzard
or serpent was the sign that he would be a medicine man. The figures
of those animals therefore were respectively the emblems of the qualities
and dispositions implied. See Fig. <a href="#page208">159</a>, supra, for a drawing of the
Sci-Manzi or “Mescal Woman” of the Kaiowa as it appears on a sacred
gourd rattle used in the mescal ceremony of that tribe, with description.</p>

<p>In Kingsborough (<i>h</i>) is the record that “in the year of Ten Houses,
or 1489, a very large comet, which they name Xihuitli, appeared.”</p>

<p>The comet is represented in the

influence in causing blights. This

worm, symbol of the rainbow, supra. The character is reproduced in

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a block of dark gray
porphyry (vulcanite) 12 feet long,
3 feet broad and 2 feet thick, the
upper left corner of which is
slightly broken off. The sculpture
occupies 9 feet of its upper part.
The upper portion represents the
head and breast of a female, surrounded
by a circle, from which
the arms project. Besides the stereotyped
frill surrounding the forehead, the only ornament of the head consists of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="page615" id="page615">[615]</a></span>
entwined rattlesnakes. The hair is of medium length and descends in tresses to the
shoulders and breast. The ear is ornamented with circular disks inclosing smaller
ones. Around the neck is a broad necklace of irregularly-shaped stones of extraordinary
size. Below the necklace the breast is covered with a kind of scarf or textile
fabric, the upper ends of which are fastened by buttons. To the center of this
scarf seems to be attached a globe, the upper part of which is adorned by a knotted
band from which four others ascend. From the lower part of the globe descends
another band, with incisions characteristic of Mexican sculpture, while its sides are
adorned by wreaths like wings. The wrists of both hands are covered with strings
of large stones perforated in the center. From the semicircular bands emanate two
of the twining staves; to the staves are attached knots, leaves, flowers, and various
other emblems of a mythical character. The most conspicuous of these is the representation
of a human face in a circle resembling the ordinary pictures of the full
moon. The two central staves, originating from the neck, pass downward, and are
differently ornamented. The fact that the head and part of the breast are surrounded
by a circle, and that the image of the moon forms one of its ornaments, induces us
to believe that this is the figure of the moon goddess. In the lower part of the
sculpture appears, again, an individual imploring the deity with face upturned and
elevated hand. The supplication is indicated by a curved staff knotted on the sides.
Excepting a circular disk attached to the hair, the head is without ornament; the
long hair hangs down to the breast and back, ending in a complicated ornament
extending below the knees. In the lobe of the ear is a small ring from which a larger
one depends. The breast is adorned with a globe similar to that on the breast of
the goddess, only it is smaller. Around the wrist of the right hand is a plain cuff,
while the left hand is covered by a skull; a stiff girdle, with a boar’s head ornamenting
its back part, surrounds the waist. This girdle differs from the previous
ones by being ornamented with circular depressions. From the front of the girdle
descend two twisted cords surrounding the thigh, and a band tied in bow and ends.
Below the right knee is a kind of garter with a pear-shaped pendant. The left foot,
with the exception of the toes, is inclosed in a sort of shoe.</p>

<p>In front of the adorer is a small altar, the cover of which has incisions similar to
those in the pendant of the globe on the breast of the deity. On the altar is a human
head, from the mouth of which issues a curved staff, while other staves in the shape
of arrows appear on the side of the head.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 980 is reproduced by permission from Lieut. H. R. Lemly (<i>a</i>),
U. S. Army, who calls it a “stone calendar.” It is the work of the
Chibcha Indians of the United States of Colombia, and its several
parts, some of which are to be compared with similar designs in other
regions, are explained as follows:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>a</i>, Ata, a small frog in the act of leaping. This animal was the base of the system, and
in this attitude denoted the abundance of water. <i>b</i>, Bosa, a rectangular figure with
various divisions, imitating cultivated fields. <i>c</i>, Mica, a bicephalous figure, with the
eyes distended, as if to examine minutely. It signified the selection and planting of
seed. <i>d</i>, Muihica, similar to the preceding, but with the eyes almost closed. It represented
the dark and tempestuous epoch in which, favored by the rain, the seed
began to sprout. <i>e</i>, Hisca, resembling <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> of the stone, but larger, with no division
between the heads. It was the symbol of the conjunction of the sun and moon,
which the Chibchas considered the nuptials or actual union of these celestial spouses&mdash;one
of the cardinal dogmas of their creed. <i>f</i>, Ta, almost identical with <i>b</i>. It represented
the harvest month. <i>g</i>, Cuhupcua, an earless human head upon one of the
lateral faces of the stone. It was the symbol of the useless or so-called deaf month
of the Chibchan year. <i>h</i>, Suhuza, perhaps a tadpole, and probably referred to the
generation of these animals. <i>i</i>, Aca, a figure of a frog, larger than <i>a</i>, but in a similar
posture. It announced the approach of the rainy season. <i>j</i>, Ulchihica, two
united rhomboids&mdash;a fruit or seed, and perhaps an ear. It referred to their invitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="page616" id="page616">[616]</a></span>
and feasts. <i>k</i>, Guesa, a human figure in an humble attitude, the hands folded, and a
halo about the head. It is supposed to represent the unfortunate youth selected as the
victim of the sacrifice made every twenty Chibchan years to the god of the harvest.</p></div>

<p>The characters <i>b</i> and <i>f</i> below, markedly resemble one given by Pipart
(<i>a</i>), with the same signification. It referred to the preparation of the
ground for sowing.</p>

<p>Wiener (<i>f</i>) gives the
following summary of
prominent Peruvian
symbols:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the conventional system
of the Peruvians a bird
indicates velocity, a lion
strength, the lion and the
bird united in one figure
strength and velocity together,
and, deductively,
power. The meander indicates
fertility and the pyramid
with degrees or steps indicates
defense. A bird combined
with the meander indicates
rapid production. A
rectangular oblong figure (the mouth) indicates speech and discourse. A circle with
a depression almost in the form of a heart means a female child, a circle with a small
blade or stalk a male child. The circle with two stalks is the symbol of a man&mdash;the
worker. The circle with four stalks means a married couple, marriage, etc.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;">
<img src="images/dp744_pg616b.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 981.</span>&mdash;Syrian symbols.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 981 is presented to show another collection of engraved symbols,
some of which with different execution resemble some found in
North America. It is a bronze
tablet found in Syria in the
collection of M. Péretié, and is
described by Maj. Claude R. Conder,
R. F. (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It measures 4&frac12; inches in height by 3&frac14;
in width. The design is supposed to
represent the fate of the soul according
to Assyrian or Phenician belief. The
tablet is divided into four compartments
horizontally, the lowest being the largest
and highest the most narrow. In the
top compartment various astronomical
symbols occur, many of which, as M.
Canneau points out, occur on other
Assyrian monuments. On the extreme
right are the seven stars, next to these
the crescent, next the winged solar disk,
then an eight-rayed star in a circle.
The remaining symbols are less easily
explained, but the last is called by M.
Canneau a “cidaris” or Persian tiara,
while another appears to approach most
nearly to the Trisul, or symbol of
“fire,” the emblem of the Indian Siva.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page617" id="page617">[617]</a></span></p>

<p>Below these symbols stand seven deities facing to the right, with long robes, and
the heads of various animals. The first to the left resembles a lion, the second a
wolf or hound, the fourth a ram, the sixth a bird, the seventh a serpent, while the
third and fifth are less easily recognized. In the third compartment a body lies on
a bier, with a deity at the head, and another at the feet. These deities have the
right hand held up, and the left down (a common feature of Indian symbolism also
observable in the attitude of the Mâlawiyeh dervishes), and the figure to the left
appears to hold a branch or three ears of corn. Both are robed in the peculiar fish-headed
costume, with a scaly body and fish tail, which is supposed to be symbolical
of the mythical Oannes, who according to Berosus, issued from the Persian gulf and
taught laws and arts to the early dwellers on the Euphrates. Behind the left-hand
fish-god is a tripod stand, on which is an indefinite object; to the right of the other
fish-god are two lion-headed human figures with eagles’ claws, apparently contending
with one another, the right arms being raised, the left holding hand by hand.
To the right of these is another figure of Assyrian type, with a domed headdress
and beard.</p>

<p>In the lowest compartment the infernal river fringed with rushes, and full of fish,
is represented. A fearful lion-headed goddess with eagles’ claws kneels on one knee
on a horse (the emblem of death) which is carried in a kneeling attitude on a boat
with bird-headed prow. The goddess crushes a serpent in either hand, and two lion
cubs are represented sucking her breasts. To the left is a demon bearing a close
resemblance to the one which supports the tablet itself, and which appears to urge on
the boat from the bank; to the right are various objects, mostly of an indefinite character,
among which M. Ganneau recognizes a vase, and a bottle, a horse’s leg with
hoof, etc.; possibly offerings to appease the infernal deities. The lion-headed goddess
might well be taken for the terrible infernal deity Kali or Durga, the worship of
whose consort, Yama, was the original source of that of the later Serapis, whose
dog was the ancestor of Cerberus. There is also a general resemblance between this
design and the well-known Egyptian picture representing the wicked soul conveyed
to hell in the form of a pig.</p>

<p>The Oannes figures take the place of the two goddesses who in Egyptian designs
stand at either end of the mummy and who form the prototype of the two angels for
whom the pious Moslem provides seats at the head and foot of his tombstone.
Perhaps the miserable horse who stumbles under the weight of the gigantic lion
goddess may represent the unhappy soul itself, while the three ears of corn remind
us of the grains of corn which have been found in skulls dug up in Syria by Capt.
Burton. Corn is intimately connected with Dagon, the Syrian fish-god.</p>

<p>As a tentative suggestion I may, perhaps, be allowed to propose that the seven
deities in the second compartment are the planets, and that the symbols above
belong to them as follows, commencing on the right:</p></div>

</table></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The serpent is often the emblem of Saturn, who, as the eldest of the seven (“the
great serpent father of the gods”), naturally comes first and therefore on the right,
and has seven stars for his symbol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page618" id="page618">[618]</a></span></p>

<p>The moon, according to Lenormant, was always an older divinity than the sun.</p>

<p>The boar is often an emblem of the sun in its strength.</p>

<p>The disc (litu) was the weapon employed by Marduk, the warrior god, as mentioned
by Lenormant.</p>

<p>The two pillars of Hermes are the proper emblem of the ancient Set or Thoth, the
planet Mercury.</p>

<p>The trisul belongs properly to the Asherah, god or goddess of fertility&mdash;the planet
Venus.</p>

<p>The Cidaris occurs in the Bavian sculptures in connection with a similar emblem.
In the Chaldean system, Jupiter and Venus occur together as the youngest of the
planets.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the position of the arms and the long robe covering
the feet resemble the attitudes and dress of the Mâlawîyeh dervishes in their sacred
dance, symbolic of the seven planets revolving (according to the Ptolemaic system)
round the earth.</p></div>

<p>Didron (<i>c</i>) thus remarks upon the emblems in the Roman catacombs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The large fish marks the fisher who catches it or the manufacturer who extracts
the oil from it. The trident indicates the sailor, as the pick the digger. The trade
of digger in the catacombs was quite elevated; the primitive monuments thus
represent these men who are of the lower class among us, and who in the beginning
of the Christian era, when they dug the graves of saints and martyrs, were interred
side by side with the rich and even beside saints, and were represented holding a
pickaxe in one hand and a lamp in the other; the lamp lighted them in their subterranean
labors. The hatchet indicates a carpenter, and the capital a sculptor or
an architect. As to the dove, it probably designates the duties of the mother of a
family who nourishes the domestic birdlings as would appear to be indicated by a
mortuary design in Bosis. It is possible, moreover, that it originated from a symbolic
idea, but this idea would be borrowed from profane rather than religious
sentiments, and I would more willingly see in it the memorial of the good qualities
of the dead, man or woman, the fidelity of the wife, or of the dove, which returning
to the ark after the deluge announced that the waters had retired and the land had
again appeared; from this we can not conclude that the fish filled a rôle analogous
to it, nor above all that it is the symbol of Christ; the dove is in the Old Testament,
the fish neither in the old nor in the new.</p></div>

<p>Edkins (<i>b</i>) says respecting the Chinese:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is easy to trace the process of symbol-making in the words used for the crenelated
top of city walls, which are ya and c’hi, both meaning “teeth” and both being
pictures of the object, and further, when the former is found also to be used for
“tree buds” and “to bud.” Such instances of word creation show how considerable
has been the prevalence of analogy and the association of ideas. The picture writing
of the Chinese is to a large extent a continuation of the process of forming analogies
to which the human mind had already become accustomed in the earlier stages of
the history of language.</p></div>

<p>D’Alviella (<i>b</i>) furnishes this poetical and truthful suggestion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not surprising that the Hindoos and Egyptians should both have adopted as
the symbol of the sun the lotus flower, which opens its petals to the dawn and
infolds them on the approach of night, and which seems to be born of itself on the
surface of the still waters.</p></div>


<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">SIGNIFICANCE OF COLORS.</span></h3>

<p>The use of color to be considered in studies of pictography is probably
to be traced to the practice of painting on the surface of the human
body. This use is very ancient. The Ethiopians in the army of Xerxes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page619" id="page619">[619]</a></span>
applied vermillion and white plaster to their skins, and the German
tribes when first known in history inscribed their breasts with the figures
of divers animals. The North British clans were so much addicted
to paint (or perhaps tattoo) that the epithet Picti was applied
to them by the Romans. In this respect comparisons may be made
with the Wichita, who were called by the French Pawnees Piqués,
commonly rendered in English Pawnee Picts, and Marco de Niça, in Hakluyt,
(<i>e</i>) says that Indians in the region of Arizona and New Mexico were
called Pintados “because they painted their faces, breasts, and arms.”
The general belief with regard to the employment of paint in the above
and similar cases is that the colors had a tribal significance by which
men became their own flags; the present form of flag not having great
antiquity, as Clovis was the first among western monarchs to adopt it.
Then the theory became current that colored devices, such as appeared
on ensigns and on clothing, e. g., tartans, were imitated from the
painted marks on the skin of the tribesmen. In this connection remarks
made supra about tattoo designs are applicable. There is but little
evidence in favor of the theory, save that fashions in colored decorations
probably in time became tribal practices and so might have been evolved
into emblems. But it is proper to regard such colorations as primarily
ornamental, and to remember that even in England as late as the eighth
century some bands of men were so proud of their decorated bodies
that they refused to conceal them by clothes.</p>

<p>This topic may be divided into: 1. Decorative use of color. 2. Idiocrasy
of colors. 3. Color in ceremonies. 4. Color relative to death
and mourning. 5. Colors for war and peace. 6. Colors designating
social status.</p>


<h4>DECORATIVE USE OF COLOR.</h4>

<p>The following notes give instances of the use of painting which appear
to be purely decorative:</p>

<p>Fernando Alarchon, in Hakluyt, (<i>f</i>) says of the Indians of the Bay
of California: “These Indians came decked after sundry fashions, some
came with a painting that couered their face all ouer, some had their
faces halfe couered, but all besmouched with cole and euery one as it
liked him best.”</p>

<p>John Hawkins, in Hakluyt, (<i>g</i>) speaking of the Florida Indians, tells
of “Colours both red, blacke, yellow, and russet, very perfect, wherewith
they so paint their bodies and Deere skinnes which they weare about
them, that with water it neither faded away nor altereth in color.”</p>

<p>Maximilian of Wied (<i>f</i>), reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Even in the midst of winter the Mandans wear nothing on the upper part of the
body, under their buffalo robe. They paint their bodies of a reddish brown colour,
on some occasions with white clay, and frequently draw red or black figures on their
arms. The face is, for the most part, painted all over with vermillion or yellow, in
which latter case the circumference of the eyes and the chin are red. There are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page620" id="page620">[620]</a></span>
however, no set rules for painting, and it depends on the taste of the Indian dandy;
yet, still, a general similarity is observed. The bands, in their dances and also
after battles, and when they have performed some exploit, follow the established
rule. In ordinary festivals and dances, and whenever they wish to look particularly
fine, the young Mandans paint themselves in every variety of way, and each endeavors
to find out some new mode. Should he find another dandy painted just like
himself, he immediately retires and makes a change in the pattern, which may happen
three or four times during the festival. If they have performed an exploit, the
entire face is painted jet black.</p></div>

<p>A colored plate in the report of the Pacific Railroad Expedition (<i>f</i>)
shows the designs adopted by the Mojave Indians for painting the
body. These designs consist of transverse lines extending around the
body, arms, and legs, or horizontal lines or different parts may partake
of different designs. Clay is now generally used.</p>

<p>Everard F. im Thurn (<i>h</i>) describes the painting of the Indians of
Guiana as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The paint is applied either in large masses or in patterns. For example, a man,
when he wants to dress well, perhaps entirely coats both his feet up to the ankles with
a crust of red; his whole trunk he sometimes stains uniformly with blue-black, more
rarely with red, or covers it with an intricate pattern of lines of either color; he puts
a streak of red along the bridge of his nose; where his eyebrows were till he pulled
them out he puts two red lines; at the top of the arch of his forehead he puts a big
lump of red paint, and probably he scatters other spots and lines somewhere on his
face. The women, especially among the Ackawoi, who use more body-paint than
other ornament, are more fond of blue-black than of red; and one very favorite ornament
with them is a broad band of this, which edges the mouth, and passes from the
corners of that to the ears. Some women especially affect certain little figures, like
Chinese characters, which look as if some meaning were attached to them, but which
the Indians are either unable or unwilling to explain.</p></div>

<p>Kohl (<i>a</i>) says of the Indians met by him around Lake Superior that
“The young men only paint&mdash;no women. When they become old they
stop and cease to pluck out their beards which are an obstacle in painting.”
It is probable that the custom of plucking the hairs originated in
the attempt to facilitate face and body painting.</p>

<p>Herndon (<i>b</i>) gives the following report from the valley of the Amazon:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Met a Conibo on the beach. This man was evidently the dandy of his tribe. He was
painted with a broad stripe of red under each eye; three narrow stripes of blue were
carried from one ear, across the upper lip to the other&mdash;the two lower stripes plain,
and the upper one bordered with figures. The whole of the lower jaw and chin
were painted with a blue chain-work of figures, something resembling Chinese
figures.</p></div>

<p>According to Dr. J. J. von Tschudi (<i>b</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The uncivilized Indians of Peru paint their bodies, but not exactly in the tattoo manner;
they confine themselves to single stripes. The Sensis women draw two stripes
from the shoulder, over each breast, down to the pit of the stomach; the Pirras women
paint a band in a form of a girdle round the waist, and they have three of a darker
color round each thigh. These stripes, when once laid on, can never be removed by
washing. They are made with the unripe fruit of one of the Rubiacaceæ. Some
tribes paint the face only; others, on the contrary, do not touch that part; but bedaub
with colors their arms, feet, and breasts.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page621" id="page621">[621]</a></span></p>

<p>F. J. Mouat, M. D., in Jour. Roy. Geogr. Soc., (<i>a</i>) says that Andaman
Islanders rub red earth on the top of the head, probably for the
purpose of ornamentation. This fashion is similar to that of some
North American Indian tribes which rub red pigment on the parting
of the hair.</p>

<p>Marcano (<i>e</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The present Piaroas of Venezuela are in the habit of painting their bodies, but by
a different process. They make stamps out of wood, which they apply to their skins
after covering them with coloring matter.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/dp749_pg621.jpg" width="600" height="430" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 982.</span>&mdash;Piaroa color stamps.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 982 shows examples of these stamps. The most noteworthy
thing about them is that they reproduce the types of certain petroglyphs,
particularly of those of the upper Cuchivero (see Figs. <a href="#page195">152</a> and
<a href="#page195">153</a>, supra).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Piaroas either copied the models they found carved on the rocks by peoples
who preceded them, or they are aware of their meaning and preserved the tradition of
it. The former hypothesis is the only tenable one. Not being endowed with inventive
faculties, it seems more natural that they should simply have copied the only
models they found. The Indians of French Guiana paint themselves in order to
drive away the devil when they start on a journey or for war, whence Crevaux concludes
that the petroglyphs must have been carved for a religious purpose. But
painting is to the Piaroas a question of ornamentation and of necessity. It is a sort
of garment that protects them against insects, and which, applied with extra care,
becomes a fancy costume to grace their feasts and meetings.</p></div>

<p>It is to be noted that at least one instance is found of the converse
of the Piaroa practice, by which the face-marks are used as the designs
of pictographs on inanimate objects. The Serranos, near Los Angeles,
California, formerly cut lines upon the trees and posts marking boundaries
of land, these lines corresponding to those adopted by the owner
as facial decorations.</p>

<p>A suggestion appropriate to this branch of the topic is presented in
the answer communicated in a personal conversation of a Japanese
lady who was asked why she blackened her teeth: “Any dog has white<span class="pagenum"><a name="page622" id="page622">[622]</a></span>
teeth!” An alteration of the physical appearance is itself a distinction,
and the greater the difference between the decorated person and
the want of decoration in others the greater the distinction. Modern
milliners, dressmakers, tailors and hatters, and their patrons pursue the
same ends of fashionable distinction which are exhibited in rivalry for
priority and singularity. These arbitrary fluctuations of fashion, which
are seen equally in the Mandan and the millionaire, the Pueblan and the
Parisian, are to be considered with reference to the supposed tribal
significance of colors before mentioned. So far as they originated in
fashion they changed with fashion, and the studies made in the preparation
of this paper tend to a disbelief in their distinctness and stability.
The conservatism of religious and of other ceremonial practices
and of social customs preserved, however, a certain amount of consistency
and continuity.</p>

<h4>IDEOCRASY OF COLORS.</h4>

<p>It has often been asserted that there was and is an intrinsic significance
in the several colors. A traditional recognition of this among
the civilizations connected with modern Europe is shown by the associations
of death and mourning with black, of innocence and peace with
white, danger with red, and epidemic disease officially with yellow.
A comparison of the diverse conceptions attached to the colors will
show great variety in their several attributions.</p>

<p>The Babylonians represented the sun and its sphere of motion by
gold, the moon by silver, Saturn by black, Jupiter by orange, Mars by
red, Venus by pale yellow, and Mercury by deep blue. Red was anciently
and generally connected with divinity and power both priestly
and royal. The tabernacle of the Israelites was covered with skins
dyed red, and the gods and images of Egypt and Chaldea were of that
color, which to this day is the one distinguishing the Roman Pontiff and
the cardinals.</p>

<p>In ancient art each color had a mystic sense or symbolism, and its
proper use was an essential consideration. With regard to early
Christian art Mrs. Clement (<i>a</i>) furnishes the following account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>White is worn by the Saviour after his resurrection; by the Virgin in representations
of the Assumption; by women as the emblem of chastity; by rich men to
indicate humility; and by the judge as the symbol of integrity. It is represented
sometimes by silver or the diamond, and its sentiment is purity, virginity, innocence,
faith, joy, and light.</p>

<p>Red, the color of the ruby, speaks of royalty, fire, divine love, the holy spirit, creative
power, and heat. In an opposite sense it symbolized blood, war, and hatred.
Red and black combined were the colors of Satan, purgatory, and evil spirits. Red
and white roses are emblems of love and innocence or love and wisdom, as in the
garland of St. Cecilia.</p>

<p>Blue, that of the sapphire, signified heaven, heavenly love and truth, constancy
and fidelity. Christ and the Virgin Mary wear the blue mantle; St. John a blue
tunic.</p>

<p>Green, the emerald, the color of spring, expressed hope and victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page623" id="page623">[623]</a></span></p>

<p>Yellow or gold was the emblem of the sun, the goodness of God, marriage and
fruitfulness. St. Joseph and St. Peter wear yellow. Yellow has also a bad signification
when it has a dirty, dingy hue, such as the usual dress of Judas, and then
signifies jealousy, inconstancy, and deceit.</p>

<p>Violet or amethyst signified passion and suffering or love and truth. Penitents,
as the Magdalene, wear it. The Madonna wears it after the crucifixion, and Christ
after the resurrection.</p>

<p>Gray is the color of penance, mourning, humility, or accused innocence.</p>

<p>Black with white signified humility, mourning, and purity of life. Alone, it spoke
of darkness, wickedness, and death, and belonged to Satan. In pictures of the
Temptation Jesus sometimes wears black.</p></div>

<p>The associations with the several colors above mentioned differ widely
from those in modern folk-lore; for instance, those with green and yellow,
the same colors being stigmatized in the old song that “green’s
forsaken and yellow’s forsworn.”</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de Dieu</span>, by Didron (<i>d</i>), contains the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The hierarchy of colors could well, in the ideas of the Middle Ages, have been allied
at the same time to symbolism. The most brilliant color is gold, and here it is given
to the greatest saints. Silver, color of the moon, which is inferior to the sun, but
its companion, however, should follow; then red, or the color of fire, attribute of
those who struggle against passion, and which is inferior to the two metals, gold
and silver, to the sun and moon, of which it is but an emanation; next green, which
symbolizes hope, and which is appropriate to married people; lastly, the uncertain
yellowish color, half white and half yellow, a modified color, which is given to saints
who were formerly sinners, but who have succeeded in reforming themselves and
are made somewhat bright in the sight of God by penitence.</p></div>

<p>A note in the Am. Journal of Psychology, Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, November, 1887, p.
190, gives another list substantially as follows:</p>

<h4>COLOR IN CEREMONIES.</h4>

<p>The colors attributed to the cardinal points have been the subject of
much discussion. Some of these special color schemes of the North
American Indians are now mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. James Stevenson, in an address before the Anthropological Society
of Washington, D. C.; Dr. Washington Matthews, U. S. Army,
in the Fifth Ann. Rep. of the Bureau of Ethnology, p. 449; and Mr.
Thomas V. Keam, in a MS. contribution, severally report the tribes
mentioned below as using in their ceremonial dances the respective
colors designated to represent the four cardinal points, viz:</p>


<div class="center">

<tr><td>Keam&mdash;Moki</td><td>White.</td><td>Red.</td><td>Yellow.</td><td>Blue.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Mr. Stevenson, in his paper on the Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis, in
the Eighth Ann. Rep. of the Bureau of Ethnology, agrees with Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page624" id="page624">[624]</a></span>
Matthews regarding the ceremonial scheme of the Navajo colors symbolic
of the cardinal points, as follows: “The eagle plumes were laid to
the east, and near by them white corn and white shell; the blue feathers
were laid to the south, with blue corn and turquoise; the hawk feathers
were laid to the west, with yellow corn and abalone shell; and to the
north were laid the whippoorwill feathers, with black beads and corn
of all the several colors.”</p>

<p>In A Study of Pueblo Architecture, by Mr. Victor Mindeleff, in the
Eighth Ann. Rep. of the Bureau of Ethnology, the prayers of consecration
by the Pueblos are addressed thus:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centred">

To the west: Siky’ak&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oma’uwu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow cloud.<br />
To the south: Sa’kwa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oma’uwu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue cloud.<br />
To the east: Pal’a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oma’uwu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red cloud.<br />
To the north: Kwetsh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oma’uwu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White cloud.
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Frank H. Cushing, in Zuñi Fetiches, Second Ann. Rep., Bureau
of Ethnology, pp. 16-17, gives the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In ancient times, while yet all beings belonged to one family, Po-shai-ang-k’ia, the
father of our sacred bands, lived with his children (disciples) in the City of the
Mists, the middle place (center) of the medicine societies of the world. When he
was about to go forth into the world he divided the universe into six regions,
namely, the North (Direction of the swept or barren place); the West (Direction of
the Home of the Waters); the South (Direction of the Place of the Beautiful Red);
the East (Direction of the Home of Day); the Upper Regions (Direction of the
Home of the High); and the Lower Regions (Direction of the Home of the Low).</p>

<p>In the center of the great sea of each of these regions stood a very ancient sacred
place&mdash;a great mountain peak. In the North was the Mountain Yellow, in the West
the Mountain Blue, in the South the Mountain Red, in the East the Mountain
White, above the Mountain All-color, and below the Mountain Black.</p>

<p>We do not fail to see in this clear reference to the natural colors of the regions referred
to&mdash;to the barren North and its auroral hues, the West with its blue Pacific,
the rosy South, the white daylight of the east, the many hues of the clouded sky,
and the black darkness of the “caves and holes of earth.” Indeed these colors are
used in the pictographs and in all the mythic symbolism of the Zuñis to indicate the
directions or regions respectively referred to as connected with them.</p></div>

<p>Mr. A. S. Gatschet (<i>a</i>), in Proc. Am. Philos. Soc., gives the symbolic
colors of the Isleta Pueblo for the points of the compass, as “white for
the east; from there they go to the north, which is black; to the west,
which is blue; and to the south, which is red.”</p>

<p>Mr. James Mooney, in Seventh Ann. Rep., Bureau Ethnology, p. 342,
says that the symbolic color system of the Cherokees is:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centred">
East&mdash;red&mdash;success; triumph.<br />
North&mdash;blue&mdash;defeat; trouble.<br />
West&mdash;black&mdash;death.<br />
South&mdash;white&mdash;peace; happiness.
</div></div>

<p>In the ceremonies of the Indians of the plains it is common that the
smoke of the sacred pipe should be turned first directly upward, second
directly downward, and then successively to the four cardinal points,
but without absolute agreement among the several tribes as to the
order of that succession. In James’ Long (<i>i</i>), it is reported that in a
special ceremony of the Omaha regarding the buffalo the first whiff of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page625" id="page625">[625]</a></span>
smoke was directed to them, next to the heavens, next to the earth,
and then successively to the east, west, north, and south. The rather
lame explanation was given that the east was for sunrise, the west for
sunset, the north for cold country, and the south for warm country.</p>

<p>The Count de Charencey, in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des Couleurs considérés comme symboles
des Pointes de l’Horizon</span>, etc., and in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ages ou Soleils</span>, gives as
the result of his studies that in Mexico and Central America the original
systems were as follows:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centred">
<p><i>Quaternary system.</i> <br />
East&mdash;Yellow.<br />
North&mdash;Black.<br />

<i>Quinary system.</i><br />
South&mdash;Blue.<br />
East&mdash;Red.<br />
North&mdash;Yellow.<br />
West&mdash;White.<br />
Center&mdash;Black.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. John Crawford (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Java the divisions of the horizon and the corresponding colors were named in
the following order: first, white and the east; second, red and the south; third,
yellow and the west; fourth, black and the north; and fifth, mixed colors and the
focus or center.</p></div>

<p>Boturini (<i>a</i>) gives the following arrangement of the “symbols of the
four parts or angles of the world,” comparing it with that of Gemelli:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="tdl" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<p>Herrera (<i>a</i>) speaks only of the year symbols and colors, and, although
he does not directly connect them, indicates his understanding in regard
thereto by the order in which he mentions them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They divided the year into four signs, being four figures; the one of a house,
another of a rabbit, the third of a cane, the fourth of a flint, and by them they
reckoned the year as it passed on. * * * They painted a sun in the middle from
which issued four lines or branches in a cross to the circumference of the wheel, and
they turned so that they divided it into four parts and the circumference and each
of them moved with its branch of the same color, which were four&mdash;green, blue, red,
and yellow.</p></div>

<p>From this statement Prof. Cyrus Thomas, in Notes on certain Maya
and Mexican Manuscripts, Third Ann. Rep., Bureau of Ethnology,
concludes that Herrera’s arrangement would presumably be as follows:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centred">

Calli&mdash;Green.<br />
Tochtli&mdash;Blue.<br />
Acatl&mdash;Red.<br />
Tecpatl&mdash;Yellow.
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page626" id="page626">[626]</a></span></p>

<p>Combining these several lists it would appear that Calli, color green,
was Fire and West or Earth and East; Tochtli, color blue, was Earth
and South or Air and North; Acatl, color red, was Water and East or
Water and West; Tecpatl, color yellow, was Air and North or Fire
and South.</p>

<p>The foregoing notes leave the symbolic colors of the cardinal points
in a state of confusion, and on calm reflection no other condition could
be expected. Taking the idea of the ocean blue, for instance, and recognizing
the impressive climatic effects of the ocean, the people examined
may be in any direction from the ocean and to each of them its
topographic as well as color relation differs. If it shall be called blue,
the color blue may be north, south, east, or west. So as to the concepts
of heat and cold, however presented in colors by the fancy, heat
being sometimes red and sometimes yellow, cold being sometimes considered
as black by the manifestation of its violent destruction of the
tissues and sometimes being more simply shown as white, the color of
the snow. Also the geographic situation of the people must determine
their views of temperature. The sun in tropical regions may be an
object of terror, in Arctic climes of pure beneficence, and in the several
seasons of more temperate zones the sun as fire, whether red or
yellow, may be destructive or life-giving. Regarding the symbols
of the cardinal points it seems that there is nothing intrinsic as to colors,
but that the ideograms connected with the topic are local and variant.
As the ancient assignments of color to the cardinal points are
not established and definite among people who have been long settled
in their present habitat, the hope of tracing their previous migration
by that line of investigation may not be realized.</p>

<p>The following account of the degree posts of the Grand Medicine
Society of the Ojibwa is condensed from an article by Dr. Hoffman in
the Am. Anthropologist for July, 1889:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In constructing the inclosure in which the Midē' priests practice the rites and
ceremonies of initiation, a single post, from 4 to 5 feet in height and about 8 inches
thick, is planted at a point opposite the main entrance, and about three-fourths
the entire distance of the interior from it. This post is painted red, with a band of
green about the top, of the width of a palm.</p>

<p>The red and green colors are used to designate the Midē' society, but for what reason
is not positively known. The green appears to have some connection with the south,
the sources of heat and abundance of crops; the thunder-bird also comes from that
direction in the springtime, bringing rain, which causes the grass and fruits to grow,
giving an abundance of food.</p>

<p>For the second degree two posts are erected within the inclosure, the first being
like that for the first degree, the second being planted nearer the main entrance,
though not far from the opposite end of the structure; this post is painted red and
is covered with white spots made by applying white clay with the finger tip. These
spots are symbolical of the migis shell, the sacred emblem of the Grand Medicine
Society.</p>

<p>The third degree contains three posts, the two preceding ones being used, to which
a third is added and planted in a line with them; this post is painted black.</p>

<p>In the fourth degree the additional post is really a cross, a crosspiece of wood being<span class="pagenum"><a name="page627" id="page627">[627]</a></span>
attached near the top; the lower part of the upright piece is squared, the side on
the east being painted white; on the south, green; on the west, red; and on the
north, black. The white is the source of light facing the direction of the rising sun,
the green, apparently the source of warmth, rains, and abundance of crops, while
the north is black, and pertains to the region from which come cold, disease, and
desolation. The red is placed upon the western side, but there is a diversity of
opinion regarding its significance. The most plausible theory appears to relate to the
“road of the dead,” referred to in the ritual of the Ghost Society, as the path upon
which the departed shadow partakes of the gigantic strawberry which he finds.
The upper portion of the cross is white, upon which are placed irregularly red spots.</p></div>

<p>In the same article is the following account of face coloring in the
Midē' degrees:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In connection with the colors of the degree posts, there is a systematic arrangement
of facial ornamentation, each style to be characteristic of one of the four degrees,
as well as the degree of the Ghost Society.</p>

<p>According to the White Earth (Minnesota) method, the arrangement is as follows:</p>

<p>First degree. One red stripe across the face from near the ears across the tip of
the nose.</p>

<p>Second degree. One stripe as above and another across the eyes, temples, and
root of the nose.</p>

<p>Third degree. The upper half of the face painted green and the lower half red.</p>

<p>Fourth degree. The forehead and the left side of the face from the outer canthus
of the eye downward is painted green; four spots of vermilion are made with the
tip of the finger upon the forehead and four upon the green surface of the left cheek.</p>

<p>According to Sikassige, a Mille Lacs Midē' priest, the ornamentation practiced
during his youth was as follows:</p>

<p>First degree. A broad band of green across the forehead and a narrow stripe of
vermilion across the face just below the eyes.</p>

<p>Second degree. A narrow stripe of vermilion across the temple, eyelids, and the
root of the nose, a short distance above which is a similar stripe of green, then
another of vermilion, and above this again one of green.</p>

<p>Third degree. Red and white spots are daubed all over the face, the spots averaging
three-fourths of an inch each in diameter.</p>

<p>Fourth degree. Two forms are admissible; in the former the face is painted red,
with a stripe of green extended diagonally across it from the upper part of the left
temporal region to the lower part of the right cheek. In the latter the face is painted
red with two short, horizontal parallel green bars across the forehead.</p>

<p>Either of these may be adopted as a sign of mourning by a man whose deceased
son had been intended for the priesthood of the Grand Medicine Society.</p></div>

<p>The religious and ceremonial use of the color red by the New Zealanders
is mentioned by Taylor (<i>d</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Closely connected with religion, was the feeling they entertained for the Kura, or
Red Paint, which was the sacred color; their idols, Pataka, sacred stages for the
dead, and for offerings or sacrifices, Urupa graves, chief’s houses, and war canoes,
were all thus painted.</p>

<p>The way of rendering anything tapu was by making it red. When a person died,
his house was thus colored; when the tapu was laid on anything, the chief erected a
post and painted it with the kura; wherever a corpse rested, some memorial was set
up, oftentimes the nearest stone, rock, or tree served as a monument; but whatever
object was selected, it was sure to be made red. If the corpse were conveyed by
water, wherever they landed a similar token was left; and when it reached its destination,
the canoe was dragged on shore, thus distinguished, and abandoned. When
the hahunga took place, the scraped bones of the chief, thus ornamented, and wrapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="page628" id="page628">[628]</a></span>
in a red-stained mat, were deposited in a box or bowl, smeared with the sacred color,
and placed in a tomb. Near his final resting place a lofty and elaborately carved
monument was erected to his memory; this was called he tiki, which was also thus
colored.</p>

<p>In former times the chief anointed his entire person with red ocher; when fully
dressed on state occasions, both he and his wives had red paint and oil poured upon
the crown of the head and forehead, which gave them a gory appearance, as though
their skulls had been cleft asunder.</p></div>

<p>Mr. S. Gason reports in Worsnop, op. cit.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the Cooper, Herbert, and Diamentina rivers of the North there are no paintings
in caves, but in special corroborees the bodies of the leading dancers are beautifully
painted with every imaginable color, representing man, woman, animals, birds,
and reptiles, the outlines being nearly faultless, and in proportion, independent of
the blending of the colors.</p>

<p>These paintings take about seven or eight hours’ hard tedious work for two men,
one in front, the other at the back of the man who is to be painted, and when these
men who are painted display themselves, surrounded by bright fires and rude torches,
it has an enchanting effect to the others. After the ceremony is over, the paintings
are allowed to be examined, and the artists congratulated or criticised.</p>

<p>At the other ceremonies, after returning from “Bookatoo” (red ocher expedition),
they paint a few of their dancers with all the colors of the rainbow, the outlines
showing all the principal species of snakes. They are well drawn and colored, and
take many hours of labor to complete.</p>

<p>These paintings of snakes are done for the purpose of having a good harvest of
snakes. The women are not allowed to attend at this ceremony, as it is one of their
strict secret dances.</p></div>

<p>A few notes of other ceremonial and religious uses of color are presented.</p>

<p>Capt. John G. Bourke (<i>f</i>) says that the Moki employ the colors in
prayers&mdash;yellow for pumpkins, green for corn, and red for peaches.
Black and white bands are typical of rain, and red and blue bands, of
lightning.</p>

<p>In James’s Long (<i>k</i>), it is mentioned of the Omaha that the boy who
goes to fast on the hill top to see his guardian spirit, as a preparation rubs
his body over with whitish clay, but the same ceremonial among the
Ouenebigonghelins near Hudson bay is described by Bacqueville de la
Potherie (<i>d</i>), with the statement that the postulant paints his face black.</p>

<p>Peter Martyr (<i>a</i>) says the natives of the Island of Hispaniola [Haiti]
when attending a festival at the religious edifice, go in a procession
having their bodies and faces painted in black, red, and yellow colors.
Some had feathers of the parrot and other birds, with which they
decorated themselves. The women had no decoration.</p>

<p>Pénicaut’s Relation, A. D. 1704, in Margry (<i>f</i>), gives an account of
decorations of the victims who die with the grand chief, or Sun of the
Natchez. Their faces were painted vermilion, as the author says, “lest
they by paleness should show their fear.” Though the practice may
have thus originated as a mere expedient, red thus used would become
in time a sacrificial color.</p>

<p>But the color red can not always be deduced from such an origin. It is
connected with the color of fire and of blood. The Romans on great festivals<span class="pagenum"><a name="page629" id="page629">[629]</a></span>
painted the face of Jupiter Capitolinus with vermilion. They
painted in the same way all the statues of the gods, demi-gods, heroes,
fauns, and satyrs. Pan is described by Virgil in Ecl. X, line 27:</p>

<p lang="la" xml:lang="la">
Pan, deus Arcadiæ venit, quem vidimus ipsi<br />
Sanguineis ebuli baccis minioque rubentem.
</p>

<p>These verses are rendered with spirit by R. C. Singleton, Virgil in
English Rhythm, London, 1871, though the translator wrote “cinnabar”
instead of “red lead” and might as well have used the correct
word, “minium,” which has the same prosodial quantity as cinnabar.</p>

<p>
Pan came, the god of Arcady, whom we<br />
Ourselves beheld, with berries bloody red<br />
Of danewort, and with cinnabar aglow.<br />
</p>

<p>In Chapman’s translation of Homer’s hymn to Pan the god is again
represented stained with red, but with the original idea of blood.</p>

<p>
A lynx’s hide, besprinkled round about<br />
With blood, cast on his shoulders.<br />
</p>

<p>By imitation of greatness and the semblance of divinity the faces of
generals when they rode in triumph, e. g., Camillus as mentioned by
Pliny, quoting Verrius, were painted red.</p>

<p>On the tree which supports the Vatican figure of the Apollo
Belvedere are traces of an object supposed to be the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στέμμα δελφικόν</span>,
which was composed of bushy tufts of Delphian laurel bound with
threads of red wool into a series of knots and having at each end a
tassel. This is an old sign of consecration and is possibly connected
with the traditional gipsy sign of mutual binding in love signified by a
red knot, as mentioned in a letter from Mr. Charles G. Leland.</p>

<p>The Spaniards distinguished red as the color par excellence, and
among many of the savage and barbaric peoples red is the favorite and
probably once was the sacred color.</p>


<h4>COLOR RELATIVE TO DEATH AND MOURNING.</h4>

<p>Charlevoix (<i>a</i>) says of the Micmacs that “their mourning consisted
in painting themselves black and in great lamentations.”</p>

<p>Champlain (<i>f</i>), in 1603, described the mourning posts of the northeastern
Algonquian tribes as painted red.</p>

<p>Keatings’ Long (<i>g</i>) tells that the Sac Indians blackened themselves
with charcoal in mourning and during its continuance did not use any
vermilion or other color for ornamentation.</p>

<p>Some of the Dakota tribes blackened the whole face with charcoal
for mourning, but ashes were also frequently employed.</p>

<p>Col. Dodge (<i>a</i>) says that the Sioux did not use the color green in life,
but that the corpses were wrapped in green blankets. The late Rev.
S. D. Hinman, who probably was, until his death within the last year,
the best authority concerning those Indians, contradicts this statement
in a letter, declaring that the Sioux frequently use the color green in
their face-painting, especially when they seek to disguise themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page630" id="page630">[630]</a></span>
as it gives so different an expression. If it is not used as generally as
blue or yellow the reason is that it is seldom found in the clays which
were formerly relied upon and therefore it required compounding. Also
they do not use green as painting or designation for the dead, but red,
that being their decoration for the “happy hunting ground.” But the
color for the mourning of the survivors is black.</p>

<p>Thomas L. McKenny (<i>a</i>) says the Chippeway men mourn by painting
their faces black.</p>

<p>The Winnebago men blacken the whole face with charcoal in mourning.
The women make a round black spot on both cheeks.</p>

<p>Dr. Boas, in Am. Anthrop. (<i>a</i>), says of Snanaimuq, a Salish tribe:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The face of the deceased is painted red and black. After the death of husband or
wife the survivor must paint his legs and his blanket red. For three or four days
he must not eat anything; then three men or women give him food, and henceforth
he is allowed to eat.</p></div>

<p>In Bancroft (<i>d</i>) it is mentioned that the Guatemalan widower dyed
his body yellow.</p>

<p>Carl Bock (<i>b</i>) describes the mourning solemnities in Borneo as being
marked chiefly by white, the men and women composing the mourning
processions being enveloped in white garments, and carrying white
flags and weapons and ornaments, all of which were covered with white
calico.</p>

<p>A. W. Howitt (<i>h</i>) says of the Dieri of Central Australia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A messenger who is sent to convey the intelligence of a death is smeared all over
with white clay. On his approach to the camp the women all commence screaming
and crying most passionately. * * * Widows and widowers are prohibited by
custom from uttering a word until the clay of mourning has worn off, however long
it may remain on them. They do not, however, rub it off, as doing so would be considered
a bad omen. It must absolutely wear off of itself. During this period they
communicate by means of gesture language.</p></div>

<p>A. C. Haddon (<i>b</i>) tells that among the western tribes of Torres strait
plastering the body with gray mud was a sign of mourning.</p>

<p>Elisée Reclus (<i>c</i>) says: “In sign of mourning the Papuans daub themselves
in white, yellow, or black, according to the tribes.”</p>

<p>D’Albertis (<i>d</i>) reports that the women of New Guinea paint themselves
black all over on the death of a relation, but that there are degrees
of mourning among the men, e. g., the son of the deceased paints
his whole body black, but other less related mourners may only paint
the face more or less black. In Vol. II, p. 9, a differentiation is shown,
by which in one locality the women daubed themselves from head to
foot with mud. The same author says, in the same volume, p. 378,
that the skulls preserved in their houses are always colored red and
their foreheads frequently marked with some rough design.</p>

<p>In Armenia, as told in The Devil Worshipers of Armenia, in Scottish
Geog. Mag., <span class="smcap">viii</span>, p. 592, widows dress in white.</p>

<p>In Notes in East Equatorial Africa, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bull. Soc. d’Anthrop. de Brux.</span>
(<i>b</i>), it is told that in the region mentioned the women rub flour over
their bodies on the death or departure of the husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page631" id="page631">[631]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir G. Wilkinson (<i>a</i>) writes that the ancient Egyptians in their mourning
ceremonies wore white fillets, and describes the same use of the
color white in the funeral processions painted on the walls of Thebes.</p>

<p>Dr. S. Wells Williams (<i>a</i>) reports of the Chinese mourning colors
that “the mourners are dressed entirely in white or wear a white fillet
around the head. In the southern districts half-mourning is blue,
usually exhibited in a pair of blue shoes and a blue silken cord woven
in the queue, instead of a red one; in the northern provinces white is
the only mourning color seen.”</p>

<p>Herr von Brandt, in the Ainos and Japanese, Journal of the Anthrop.
Inst. G. B. and I. (<i>e</i>), tells that the coffins of the deceased Mikados
were covered with red, that is, with cinnabar.</p>


<h4>COLORS FOR WAR AND PEACE.</h4>

<p>These colors, respecting the Algonquian Indians, are mentioned in
1763, as published in Margry, to the effect that red feathers on the
pipe signify war, and that other colors [each of which may have a
modifying or special significance] mean peace.</p>

<p>W. W. H. Davis (<i>b</i>) recounts that “in 1680 the Rio Grande Pueblos informed
the Spanish officers that they had brought with them two
crosses, one painted red, which signified war, and the other white, which
indicated peace, and they might take their choice between the two.”</p>

<p>Capt. de Lamothe Cadillac (<i>b</i>), writing in the year 1696 of the Algonquians
of the Great Lake region near Mackinac, etc., describes
their decorations for war as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the day of departure the warriors dress in their best. They color their hair
red; they paint their faces red and black with much skill and taste, as well as the
whole of their bodies. Some have headdresses with the tail feathers of eagles or
other birds; others have them decorated with the teeth of wild beasts, such as the
wolf or tiger [wild cat]. Several adorn their heads, in lieu of hats, with helmets
bearing the horns of deer, roebuck, or buffalo.</p></div>

<p>Schoolcraft (<i>r</i>) says that blue signifies peace among the Indians of
the Pueblo of Tesuque.</p>

<p>The Dakota bands lately at Grand river agency had the practice of
painting the face red from the eyes down to the chin when going to war.</p>

<p>The Absaroka or Crow Indians generally paint the forehead red
when on the warpath. This distinction of the Crows is also noted by
the Dakota in recording pictographic narratives of encounters with the
Crows.</p>

<p>Haywood (<i>e</i>) says of the Cherokees:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When going to war their hair is combed and annointed with bear’s grease and the
red root, <i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i>, and they adorn it with feathers of various beautiful
colors, besides copper and iron rings, and sometimes wampum or peak in the ears;
and they paint their faces all over as red as vermilion, making a circle of black about
one eye and another circle of white about the other.</p></div>

<p>H. H. Bancroft (<i>e</i>) tells that when a Modoc warrior paints his face
black before going into battle it means victory or death, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page632" id="page632">[632]</a></span>
will not survive a defeat. In the same volume, p. 105, he says that when
a Thlinkit arms himself for war he paints his face and powders his hair
a brilliant red. He then ornaments his head with a white eagle feather
as a token of stern, vindictive determination.</p>

<p>Mr. Dorsey reports that when the Osage men go to steal horses from
the enemy they paint their faces with charcoal. [Possibly this may be
for disguise, on the same principle that burglars use black crape.]
The same authority gives the following description of the Osage paint
for war parties:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Before charging the foe the Osage warriors paint themselves anew. This is called
the death paint. If any of the men die with this paint on them the survivors do
not put on any other paint.</p>

<p>All the gentes on the “Left” side use the “fire paint,” which is red. It is applied
by them with the left hand all over the face. And they use prayers about the fire:
“As the fire has no mercy, so should we have none.” Then they put mud on the
cheek, below the left eye, as wide as two or more fingers. The horse is painted with
some of the mud on the left cheek, shoulder, and thigh.</p></div>

<p>The following extract is from Belden (<i>b</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sign paints used by the Sioux Indians are not numerous, but very significant.
When the warriors return from the warpath and have been successful in bringing
back scalps, the squaws, as well as the men, paint with vermilion a semicircle in
front of each ear. The bow of the arc is toward the nose and the points of the half-circle
on the top and bottom of the ear; the eyes are then reddened and all dance
over the scalps.</p></div>

<p>John Lawson (<i>a</i>) says of the North Carolina Indians:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When they go to war * * * they paint their faces all over red, and commonly
make a circle of black about one eye and another circle of white about the other,
while others bedaub their faces with tobacco-pipe clay, lampblack, black lead, and
divers other colors, etc.</p></div>

<p>De Brahm, in documents connected with the History of South
Carolina (<i>a</i>), reports that the Indians of South Carolina “painted their
faces red in token of friendship and black in expression of warlike
intentions.”</p>

<p>Rev. M. Eells (<i>a</i>) says of the Twana Indians of the Skokomish reservation
that when about to engage in war “they would tamanamus in
order to be successful and paint themselves with black and red, making
themselves as hideous as possible.”</p>

<p>The U. S. Exploring Expedition (<i>b</i>), referring to a tribe near the Sacramento
river, tells that the chief presented them with a tuft of white
feathers stuck on a stick about 1 foot long, which was supposed to be
a token of friendship.</p>

<p>Dr. Boas, in Am. Anthrop. (<i>b</i>), says of the Snanaimuq that before
setting out on war expeditions they painted their faces red and black.</p>

<p>Peter Martyr (<i>b</i>) says of the Ciguaner Indians:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The natives came out of the forest painted and daubed with spots. For it is their
custom, when they go to war, to daub themselves from the face to the knee with black
and scarlet or purple color in spots, which color they [obtain] from some curious
fruits resembling “Pyren,” which they plant and cultivate in their gardens with the
greatest care. Similarly they also cause the hair to grow in a thousand very curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="page633" id="page633">[633]</a></span>
shapes, if it is not by nature long or black enough, so that they look not otherwise
than if the similar devil or hellish Circe came running out of hell.</p></div>

<p>Curr (<i>c</i>) tells that the Australians whitened themselves with white
clay when about to engage in war. Some African tribes, according to
Du Chaillu, also paint their faces white for war.</p>

<p>Haddon (<i>c</i>) says of the western tribe of Torres straits:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When going to fight the men painted their bodies red, either entirely so or partially,
perhaps only the upper portion of the body and the legs below the knees, or
the head and upper part of the body only. The body was painted black all over by
those who were actually engaged in the death dance.</p></div>

<p>Du Chaillu (<i>c</i>) tells that among the Scandinavians there were peace
and war shields, the former white and the latter red. When the white
was hoisted on a ship it was a sign for the cessation of hostility, in the
same manner that a flag of the same color is now used to procure or
mark a truce. The red shield displayed on a masthead or in the midst
of a body of men was the sign of hostility.</p>


<h4>COLOR DESIGNATING SOCIAL STATUS.</h4>

<p>The following extract is translated, from Peter Martyr (<i>c</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For the men are in body long and straight, possess a vivid and natural complexion
which compares somewhat with a red and genuine flesh color. Their whole body
and skin is lined over with sundry paints and curious figures, which they consider
as a handsome ornament and fine decoration, and the uglier a man’s painting or
lining over is the prettier he considers himself to be, and is also regarded as the
most noble among their number.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Dorsey reports of the Osages that all the old men who have
been distinguished in war are painted with the decorations of their
respective gentes. That of the Tsicu wactake is as follows: The face
is first whitened all over with white clay; then a red spot is made on
the forehead and the lower part of the face is reddened; then with the
fingers the man scrapes off the white clay, forming the dark figures by
letting the natural color of the face show through.</p>

<p>H. H. Bancroft (<i>f</i>), citing authorities, says the central Californians
(north of San Francisco bay) formerly wore the down of Asclepias (?)
(white) as an emblem of royalty; and in the same volume, p. 691, it is
told that the natives of Guatemala wore red feathers in their hats, the
nobles only wearing green ones.</p>

<p>The notes immediately following are about the significant use of
color, not readily divisible into headings.</p>

<p>Belden (<i>c</i>) furnishes the following remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Yanktons, Sioux, Santees, and Cheyennes use a great deal of paint. A Santee
squaw paints her face the same as a white woman does, only with less taste. If she
wishes to appear particularly taking she draws a red streak half an inch wide from
ear to ear, passing it over the eyes, the bridge of the nose, and along the middle of
the cheek. When a warrior desires to be left alone he takes black paint or lampblack
and smears his face; then he draws zigzag lines from his hair to his chin by
scraping off the paint with his nails. This is a sign that he is trapping, is melancholy,
or in love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page634" id="page634">[634]</a></span></p>

<p>A Sioux warrior who is courting a squaw usually paints his eyes yellow and blue
and the squaw paints hers red. I have known squaws to go through the painful
operation of reddening the eye-balls, that they might appear particularly fascinating
to the young men. A red stripe drawn horizontally from one eye to the other means
that the young warrior has seen a squaw he could love if she would reciprocate his
attachment.</p></div>

<p>As narrated by H. H. Bancroft, the Los Angeles county Indian girls
paint the cheeks sparingly with red ocher when in love. This also
prevails among the Arikara, at Fort Berthold, Dakota.</p>

<p>La Potherie (<i>e</i>) says that the Indian girls of a tribe near Hudson bay,
when they have arrived at the age of puberty, at the time of its sign,
daub themselves with charcoal or a black stone, and in far distant
Yucatan, according to Bancroft (<i>h</i>), the young men restricted themselves
to black until they were married, indulging afterwards in varied
and bright colored figures.</p>

<p>The color green is chiefly used symbolically as that of grass, with reference
to which Father De Smet’s MS. on the dance of the Tinton Sioux
contains these remarks: “Grass is the emblem of charity and abundance;
from it the Indians derive the food for their horses and it fattens the
wild animals of the plains, from which they derive their subsistence.”</p>

<p>Brinton (<i>d</i>) gives the following summary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Both green and yellow were esteemed fortunate colors by the Cakchiquels, the
former as that of the flourishing plant, the latter as that of the ripe and golden ears
of maize. Hence, says Coto, they were also used to mean prosperity.</p>

<p>The color white, <i>zak</i>, had, however, by far the widest metaphorical uses. As the
hue of light, it was associated with day, dawn, brightness, etc.</p></div>

<p>Marshall (<i>b</i>) gives as the explanation why certain gracious official documents
are sealed with green that the color expresses youth, honor,
beauty, and especially liberty.</p>

<p>H. M. Stanley (<i>a</i>) gives the following use of white as a sign of innocence:
“Qualla drew a piece of pipeclay and marked a broad white
band running from the wrist to the shoulder along each arm of Ngalyema,
as a sign to all men present that he was guiltless.”</p>

<p>H. Clay Trumbull (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Egyptian amulet of blood friendship was red, as representing the blood of the
gods. The Egyptian word for “red” sometimes stood for “blood.” The sacred
directions in the Book of the Dead were written in red; hence follows our word
“rubrics.” The rabbis say that, when persecution forbade the wearing of the phylacteries
with safety, a red thread might be substituted for this token of the covenant
with the Lord. It was a red thread which Joshua gave to Rahab as a token of her
covenant relations with the people of the Lord. The red thread, in China, to-day,
binds the double cup, from which the bride and bridegroom drink their covenant
draught of “wedding wine,” as if in symbolism of the covenant of blood. And it is
a red thread which, in India, to-day, is used to bind a sacred amulet around the arm
or the neck. * * * Upon the shrines in India the color red shows that worship
is still living there; red continues to stand for blood.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Mooney, in the Seventh Annual Report, Bureau of Ethnology,
shows that to the Cherokee the color blue signifies grief or depression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page635" id="page635">[635]</a></span>
spirits, a curious parallel to the colloquial English phrase “has the
blues” and wholly opposite to the poetical symbol of blue for hope.</p>

<p>The notes above collected on the general topic of color symbolism
might be indefinitely extended. Those presented, however, are typical
and perhaps sufficient for the scope of the present work. In regarding
ideography of colors the first object is to expunge from consideration
all merely arbitrary or fanciful decorations, which is by no means easy,
as ancient customs, even in their decadence or merely traditional,
preserve a long influence. But as a generalization it seems that all
common colors have been used in historic times for nearly all varieties
of ideographic expression by the several divisions of men, and that they
have differed fundamentally in the application of those colors. Yet
there was an intelligent origin in each one of those applications of color.
With regard to mourning the color black is now considered to be that
of gloom. It was still earlier expressed by casting ashes or earth over
the head and frame, and possibly the somber paint was adopted for
cleanliness, the concept being preserved and indeed intensified by
durable blackness instead of the mere transient dinginess of dirt,
although the actual defilement by the latter is thereby only symbolized.
This gloom is the expression of the misery of the survivors, perhaps of
their despair as not expecting any happiness to the dead or any hope
of a meeting in another world. Other lines of thought are shown by
blue, considered as the supposed sky or heavenly home of the future,
and by green, as suggesting renewal or resurrection, and those concepts
determine the mourning color of some peoples. Red or yellow may
only refer to the conceptions of the colors of flames, and therefore might
simply be an objective representation of the disposition of the corpse,
which very often was by cremation. But sometimes these colors are
employed as decoration and display to proclaim that the dead go to
glory. White, used as frequently by the populations of the world as
other funeral colors, may have been only to assert the purity and innocence
of the departed, an anticipation of the flattering obituary notices
or epitaphs now conventional in civilized lands.</p>

<p>With regard to the color red, it may be admitted that it originally
represents blood; but it may be, and in fact is, used for the contradictory
concepts of war and peace. It is used for war as suggesting the blood
of the enemy, for peace and friendship to signify the blood relation or
blood covenant, the strongest tie of love and friendship.</p>

<p>So it would seem that, while colors have been used ideographically,
the ideas which determined them were very diverse and sometimes
their application has become wholly conventional and arbitrary. A
modern military example may be in point which has no connection with
the well-known squib of an English humorist. One of the officers of the
U. S. Army of the last generation when traveling in Europe was much
disgusted to observe that a green uniform was used in some of the
armies for the corps of engineers and for branches of the service other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page636" id="page636">[636]</a></span>
than rifles or tirailleurs. He insisted that the color naturally and
necessarily belongs to the Rifles, because the soldiers of that arm when
clad with that color were most useful as skirmishers in wooded regions.
This reason for the selection of green for the riflemen who composed a
part of the early army of the United States is correct, but in the necessity
for the distinction of special uniforms for the several component
parts of a military establishment, whether in Europe or America, the
original and often obsolete application of color was wholly disregarded
and colors were selected simply because they were not then appropriated
by other branches of the service. So in the late formation of
the signal corps of the U. S. Army, the color of orange, which had
belonged to the old dragoons, was adopted simply because it was a
good color no longer appropriated.</p>

<p>With these changes by abandonment and adoption comes fashion,
which has its strong effect. It is even exemplified where least
expected, i. e., in Stamboul. Every one knows that the descendants
of the Prophet alone are entitled to wear green turbans, but a late
Sultan, not being of the blood of Mohammed, could not wear the color,
so the emirs who could do so carefully abstained from green in his
presence and the color for the time was unfashionable.</p>

<p>As the evolution of clothing commenced with painting and tattooing,
it may be admitted that what is now called fashion must have had its
effect on the earlier as on the later forms of personal decoration.
Granting that there was an ideographic origin to all designs painted
on the person, the ambition or vanity of individuals to be distinctive
and to excel must soon have introduced varieties and afterward imitations
of such patterns, colors, or combinations as favorably struck the
local taste. The subject therefore is much confused.</p>

<p>An additional suggestion comes from the study of the Mexican
codices. In them color often seems to be used according to the fancy
of the scribe. Compare pages 108 and 109 of the Codex Vaticanus, in
Kingsborough, Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>, with pages 4 and 5 of the Codex Telleriano
Remensis, in part 4 of Kingsborough, Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, where the figures and their
signification are evidently the same, but the coloration is substantially
reversed.</p>

<p>A comparison of Henry R. Schoolcraft’s published coloration with
the facts found by the recent examination of the present writer is
set forth with detail on page <a href="#page202">202</a>, supra.</p>

<p>In his copious illustrations colors were exhibited freely and with
stated significance, whereas, in fact, the general rule in regard to the
birch-bark rolls is that they were never colored at all; indeed, the bark
was not adapted to coloration. His colors were painted on and over the
true scratchings, according to his own fancy. The metaphorical coloring
was also used by him in a manner which, to any thorough student
of the Indian philosophy and religions, seems absurd. Metaphysical
significance is attached to some of the colored devices, or, as he calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="page637" id="page637">[637]</a></span>
them, symbols, which could never have been entertained by a people in
the stage of culture of the Ojibwa, and those devices, in fact, were ideograms
or iconograms.</p>


<h3>SECTION 4.<br />

<span class="subhead">GESTURE AND POSTURE SIGNS DEPICTED.</span></h3>

<p>Among people where a system of ideographic gesture signs has prevailed
it would be expected that their form would appear in any mode
of pictorial representation used with the object of conveying ideas or
recording facts. When a gesture sign had been established and it
became necessary or desirable to draw a character or design to convey
the same idea, nothing could be more natural than to use the graphic
form or delineation which was known and used in the gesture sign. It
was but one more step, and an easy one, to fasten upon bark, skins, or
rocks the evanescent air pictures of the signs.</p>

<p>In the paper “Sign language among the North American Indians,”
published in the First Ann. Rep. of the Bureau of Ethnology, a large
number of instances were given of the reproduction of gesture lines in
the pictographs made by those Indians, and they appeared to be most
frequent when there was an attempt to convey subjective ideas. It
was suggested, therefore, that those pictographs which, in the absence
of positive knowledge, are the most difficult of interpretation were
those to which the study of sign-language might be applied with advantage.
The topic is now more fully discussed. Many pictographs
in the present work, the meaning of which is definitely known from
direct sources, are noted in connection with the gesture-signs corresponding
with the same idea, which signs are also understood from
independent evidence or legitimate deduction.</p>

<p>Dr. Edkins (<i>c</i>) makes the following remarks regarding the Chinese
characters, which are applicable also to the picture-writing of the North
American Indians, and indeed to that of all peoples among whom it
has been cultivated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The use of simple natural shapes, such as the mouth, nose, eye, ear, hand, foot, as
well as the shape of branches, trees, grass, caves, holes, rivers, the bow, the spear,
the knife, the tablet, the leaf&mdash;these formed, in addition to pictures of animals,
much of the staple of Chinese ideographs.</p>

<p>Attention should be drawn to the fact that the mouth and the hand play an exceptionally
important part in the formation of the symbols.</p>

<p>Men were more accustomed then than now to the language of signs by the use of
these organs. Perhaps three-twentieths of the existing characters are formed by
their help as one element.</p>

<p>This large use of the mouth and hand in forming characters is, as we may very
reasonably suppose, only a repetition of what took place when the words themselves
were made.</p>

<p>There is likely to be a primitive connection between demonstratives and names for
the hand, because the hand is used in pointing.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 983 is a copy of a colored petroglyph on a rock in the valley of
Tule river, California, further described on page <a href="#page052">52</a>, et seq., supra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page638" id="page638">[638]</a></span></p>

<p><i>a</i>, a person weeping. The eyes have lines running down to the breast,
below the ends of which are three short lines on either side. The arms
and hands are in the exact position for making the gesture for rain.
See <i>h</i> in Fig. <a href="#page642">999</a>, meaning eye-rain, and also Fig. <a href="#page643">1002</a>. It was probably
the intention of the artist to show that the hands in this gesture should be
passed downward over the face, as probably suggested by the short lines
upon the lower end of the tears. It is evident that sorrow is portrayed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

</div>

<p><i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, six persons apparently making the gesture for “hunger” by
passing the hands towards and backward from the sides of the body,
suggesting a gnawing sensation. The person, <i>d</i>, shown in a horizontal
position, may possibly denote a “dead man,” dead of starvation, this
position being adopted by the Ojibwa, Blackfeet, and others as a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="page639" id="page639">[639]</a></span>
device to represent a dead body. The varying lengths of head
ornaments denote different degrees of status as warriors or chiefs.</p>

<p><i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>. Human forms of various shapes making gestures for negation,
or more specifically “nothing, nothing here,” a natural and universal
gesture made by throwing one or both hands outward toward
either side of the body. The hands are extended, and, to make the
action apparently more emphatic, the extended toes are also shown on
<i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, and <i>i</i>. The several lines upon the leg of <i>i</i> probably indicate
trimmings upon the leggings.</p>

<p>The character at <i>j</i> is strikingly similar to the Alaskan pictographs
(see <i>b</i> of Fig. <a href="#page351">460</a>), indicating self with the right hand, and the left
pointing away, signifying to go.</p>

<p><i>k.</i> An ornamented head with body and legs. It may refer to a Shaman,
the head being similar to the representations of such personages
by the Ojibwa and Iroquois.</p>

<p>Similar drawings occur at a distance of about 10 miles southeast of
this locality as well as at other places toward the northwest, and it
appears probable that the pictograph was made by a portion of a tribe
which had advanced for the purpose of selecting a new camping place,
but failed to find the quantities of food necessary for sustenance, and
therefore erected this notice to inform their followers of their misfortune
and determined departure toward the northwest. It is noticeable
that the picture is so placed upon the rock that the extended arm of
<i>j</i> points toward the north.</p>

<p>The following examples are selected from a large number that could
be used to illustrate those gesture signs known to be included in pictographs.
Others not referred to in this place may readily be noticed
in several parts of the present paper where they appear under other
headings.</p>

is as follows:</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 999.</span>&mdash;Water symbols.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Chinese character for to give water is <i>a</i>, in Fig. 999, which may
be compared with the common Indian
gesture to drink, to give water, viz:
“Hand held with the tips of fingers
brought together and passed to the
mouth, as if scooping up water” (see
Fig. 1000), obviously from primitive
custom, as with Mojaves, who still
drink with scooped hands, throwing the water to the mouth.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1000.</span>&mdash;Gesture
sign for drink.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another common Indian gesture sign for water to drink&mdash;I want to
drink&mdash;is: “Hand brought downward past the mouth with loosely extended
fingers, palm toward the face.” This appears in the Mexican
character for drink, <i>b</i>, in Fig. 999, taken from Pipart (<i>a</i>). Water, i. e.,
the pouring out of water with the drops falling or about to
fall, is shown in Fig. 999, <i>c</i>, taken from the same author
(<i>b</i>), being the same arrangement of them as in the Indian
gesture-sign for rain, shown in Fig. 1002, the hand, however,
being inverted. Rain in the Mexican picture-writing
is sometimes shown by small circles inclosing a dot, as in
the last two designs, but not connected together, each
having a short line upward marking the line of descent.
Several other pictographs for rain are given below.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1001.</span>&mdash;Water, Egyptian.</p></div>
</div>

<p>With the gesture sign for drink may be compared Fig. 1001, the
Egyptian goddess Nu in the sacred sycamore
tree, pouring out the water of life
to the Osirian and his soul represented
as a bird, in Amenti, from a funereal
stelē in Cooper’s Serpent Myths (<i>b</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>The common Indian gesture for river
or stream&mdash;water&mdash;is made by passing the
horizontal flat hand, palm down, forward
and to the left from the right side in a
serpentine manner.</p>



<p>The Egyptian character for the same is <i>d</i> in Fig. 999, taken from
Champollion’s Dictionary (<i>b</i>). The broken line is held to represent the
movement of the water on the surface of the stream. When made with
one line less angular and more waving it means water. It is interesting
to compare with this the identical character in the syllabary invented
by a West African negro, Mormoru Doalu Bukere, for water, <i>e</i>, in Fig.
999, mentioned by Dr. Tylor (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page643" id="page643">[643]</a></span></p>

<p>The abbreviated Egyptian sign for water as a stream is <i>f</i>, in Fig. 999,
taken from Champollion, loc. cit., and the Chinese for the same is as in
<i>g</i>, same figure.</p>

<p>In the picture writing of the Ojibwa the Egyptian abbreviated
character, with two lines instead of
three, appears with the same signification.</p>

<p>The Egyptian character for weep,
<i>h</i>, in Fig. 999, i. e., an eye with tears
falling, is also found in the pictographs
of the Ojibwa, published by
Schoolcraft (<i>o</i>), and is also made by
the Indian gesture of drawing lines by
the index repeatedly downward
from the eye, though perhaps more
frequently made by the full sign for
rain&mdash;made with the back of the hand
downward from the eye&mdash;“eye rain.” The sign is as follows, as made
by the Shoshoni, Apache, and other Indians: Hold the hand (or hands)
at the height of and before the shoulder, fingers pendent, palm down,
then push it downward a short distance, as shown in Fig. 1002. That
for heat is the same, with the difference that the hand is held above
the head and thrust downward toward the forehead; that for to weep
is made by holding the hand as in rain, and the gesture made from the
eye downward over the cheek, back of the fingers nearly touching the
face.</p>

<p>The upper design in Fig. 1003, taken from the manuscript catalogue
of T.V. Keam, is water wrought into a meandering device,
which is the conventional generic sign of the Hopitus.
The two forefingers are joined as in the lower design in
the same figure.</p>

<p>In relation to the latter, Mr. Keam says: “At the close
of the religious festivals the participants join in a parting
dance called the ‘dance of the linked finger.’ They form
a double line, and crossing their arms in front of them
they lock the forefingers of either hand with those of their neighbors,
in both lines, which are thus interlocked together, and then dance,
still interlocked by this emblematic grip, singing their parting song.
The meandering designs are emblems of this friendly dance.”</p>

</div>


<h4>CHILD.</h4>

<p>The Arapaho sign for <i>child</i>, <i>baby</i>, is the forefinger in the mouth, i. e.,
a nursing child, and a natural sign of a deaf-mute is the same. The
Egyptian figurative character for the same is seen in Fig. 1004 <i>a</i>. Its
linear form is <i>b</i>, same figure, and its hieratic is <i>c</i>, Champollion (<i>c</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page644" id="page644">[644]</a></span></p>

<p>These afford an interpretation to the ancient Chinese form for <i>son</i>,
<i>d</i> in same figure, given in Journ. Royal Asiatic Society, <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, 1834, p. 219,
as belonging to the Shang dynasty, 1756-1112 B. C., and the modern
Chinese form, <i>e</i>, which, without the comparison, would not be supposed
to have any pictured reference to an infant with hand or finger at or
approaching the mouth, denoting the taking of nourishment. Having
now suggested this, the Chinese character for <i>birth</i>, <i>f</i> in same figure,
is understood as a parallel expression of a common gesture among
the Indians, particularly reported from the Dakota, for <i>born</i>, <i>to be born</i>;
viz, place the left hand in front of the body a little to the right, the
palm, downward and slightly arched, then pass the extended right
hand downward, forward, and upward, forming a short curve underneath
the left, as in Fig. 1005 <i>a</i>. This is based upon the curve followed
by the head of the child during birth, and is used generically. The
same curve, when made with one hand, appears in Fig. 1005 <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to compare with the Chinese <i>child</i> the Mexican
abbreviated character for <i>man</i>, Fig. 1004 <i>g</i>, found in Pipart (<i>c</i>). The
character on the right is called the abbreviated form of the one by its
side.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1004.</span>&mdash;Symbols for child and man.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Chinese character for <i>man</i> is
Fig. 1004 <i>h</i>, and may have the same
obvious conception as a Dakota sign
for the same signification: “Place
the extended index pointing upward
and forward before the lower portion
of the abdomen.”</p>

</div>

<p>A typical sign made by the Indians
for <i>no</i>, <i>negation</i>, is as follows:</p>

<p>The hand extended or slightly curved is held in front of the body, a
little to the right of the median line; it is then carried with a rapid
sweep a foot or more farther to the right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page645" id="page645">[645]</a></span></p>

<p>The sign for <i>none</i>, <i>nothing</i>, sometimes used for simple negation, is
made by throwing both hands outward from the breast toward their
respective sides.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/dp773_pg645.png" width="150" height="115" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1006.</span>&mdash;Negation.</p></div>
</div>

<p>With these compare the two forms of the Egyptian character for no,
negation, the two upper characters of Fig. 1006 taken from Champollion
(<i>d</i>). No vivid fancy is needed to see the hands
indicated at the extremities of arms extended symmetrically
from the body on each side.</p>

<p>Also compare the Maya character for the same
idea of negation, the lowest character of Fig. 1006,
found in Landa (<i>a</i>). The Maya word for negation is
“<i>ma</i>,” and the word “<i>mak</i>,” a six-foot measuring rod, given by Brasseur
de Bourbourg in his dictionary, apparently having connection
with this character, would in use separate the hands as illustrated,
giving the same form as the gesture made without the rod.</p>

<p>Another sign for <i>nothing</i>, <i>none</i>, made by the Comanche is: Flat
hand thrown forward, back to the ground, fingers pointing
forward and downward. Frequently the right hand is
brushed over the left thus thrown out.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1007.</span>&mdash;Hand.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Compare the Chinese character for the same meaning, the
upper character of Fig. 1007. This will not be recognized
as a hand without study of similar characters, which generally
have a cross-line cutting off the wrist. Here the
wrist bones follow under the crosscut, then the metacarpal
bones, and last the fingers, pointing forward and downward.</p>

<p>Leon de Rosny (<i>a</i>) gives the second and third characters in Fig. 1007
as the Babylonian glyphs for “hand,” the upper being the later and the
lower the archaic form.</p>

<p>Fig. 1009, reproduced from Fig. 365, p. 308, Sixth Ann. Rep. Bureau
of Ethnology, is a copy of Pl. 53 of the Dresden Codex, and is a good
example of the use of gestures in the Maya graphic system. The main
figure in the upper division of the plate, probably that of a deity or
ruler, holds his right hand raised to the level of the head, with the
index prominently separated from the other fingers. This is the first
part of a sign common to several of the Indian tribes of North America
and signifies affirmation or assent. The Indians close the fingers other
than the index more decidedly than in the plate and, after the hand
has reached its greatest height, shake it forward and down, but these
details, which indeed are not essential, could not well be indicated pictorially.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page647" id="page647">[647]</a></span>
The human figure in the lower division is kneeling and holds
both hands easily extended before
the body, palms down and
index fingers straight, parallel,
and separated from the other
fingers, which are flexed or
closed. This in its essentials is
a common Indian gesture sign
for “the same,” “similar,” and
also for “companion.” A sign
nearly identical is used by the
Neapolitans to mean “union”
or “harmony.” If the two divisions
of the plate are supposed
to be connected, it might be inferred
through the principles of
gesture language that the kneeling
man was praying to the
seated personage for admission
to his favor and companionship,
and that the latter was responding
by a dignified assent.</p>

<p>The upper half represents the head,
arms, and part of the breast of a deity,
apparently of advanced age, as indicated
by the wrinkles in the face.
The right arm is bent at the elbow,
the finger tips of the outstretched
hand apparently touching the region
of the heart; the left upper arm is
drawn up, the elbow being almost as
high as the shoulder, and the fore
arm and hand hanging at nearly
right angles. From the head and
neck issue winding staves, to which
not only knots or nodes are attached,
but also variously-shaped leaves,
buds, flowers, and fruits. Apparently
these are symbols of speech,
replacing our letters and expressing
the mandate of the deity.</p>

<p>The lower part represents an erect
human figure with the face turned up
toward the deity imploring, and from
the mouth emanates a staff with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page648" id="page648">[648]</a></span>
nodes variously arranged. The appeal is still further intensified by the raising of
the right hand and arm. A human head partly covers the head of the figure, from
which hang variously-shaped ribbons, terminating in the body and tail of a fish.
Above the right wrist is a double bracelet, apparently formed of small square stones.
The left hand is covered, gauntlet-like, by a human skull, and the wrist is ornamented
by a double scaly bracelet. The waist is encircled by a stiff projecting girdle,
which differs from the general style of this ornament by having attached to it
on the side a human head, with another human head suspended from it. From
the front of the girdle emanate four lines, which ascend towards the deity, uniting
at the top. They seem to symbolize the emotions of the person, not expressed by
words. From behind the image issue flames.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<span class="subhead">CONVENTIONALIZING.</span></h2>


<p>Before writing was invented by a people there were attempts in its
direction which are mentioned in other chapters of this paper. Human
forms were drawn pictorially in the act of making gesture signs and in
significant actions and attitudes and combinations of them. Other
natural objects, as well as those purely artificial, which represented
work or the result of work, were also drawn with many differing significations.
When any of these designs had become commonly adopted
on account of its striking fitness or even from frequent repetition with
a special signification, it became a conventional term of thought-writing,
with substantially the same use as when, afterward, the combinations
of letters of an alphabet into words became the arbitrary signs of
sound-writing. While the designs thus became conventional terms,
their forms became more and more abbreviated or cursive until in many
cases the original concept or likeness was lost. Sometimes when a
specimen of the original form is preserved, its identity in meaning with
the current form can be ascertained by correlation of the intermediate
shapes.</p>

<p>The original ideography is often exhibited by exaggeration. For
instance, a loud voice has been sometimes indicated by a human face
with an enormous mouth. Hearing, among the Peruvians, was early
expressed by a man with very large ears; then by a head with such ears,
and afterwards by the form of the ears without the head. Soon such
forms became so conventionalized as to be practically ideographic writing.
In the same manner a numeral cipher has become the representation
of a mathematical quantity, a written musical note shows a kind
and degree of sound, and other pictured signs give values of weights
and measures. All of these signs express ideas independent of any
language and may be understood by peoples speaking all diversities of
language.</p>

<p>So also the idea of smallness and subjection may be conveyed by
drawing an object in an obviously diminished size, of which examples
are given in this chapter. Another expedient, illustrations of which
also appear, is by repetition and combination, with reference to which
the following condensed remarks of James Summers (<i>a</i>) are in point:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The earliest Chinese characters were pictorial; but pictures could not be made
which would clearly express all ideas. One of the means devised to express concepts
that could not be indicated by a simple sketch, was to combine two or more familiar
pictures. For instance, a man with a large eye represents “seeing;” two men,
“to follow;” three men, “many;” two men on the ground, “sitting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page650" id="page650">[650]</a></span></p>

<p>All other means failing, the present great mass of characters was formed by a
principle from which the class is called “phonetic;” because in the characters classed
under it, while one part (called the “radical”) preserves its meaning, the other part
(called the “phonetic” or “primitive”) is used to give its own sound to the whole
figure. This part does sometimes, however, convey also its symbolic meaning as
well as its sound.</p></div>

<p>But while the original mode of expressing ideas required various
devices, when an idea had become established in pictography there
always appeared an attempt to simplify the figure and reduce it in
size, so as to require less space in the drafting surface and also to lessen
the draftsman’s labor. This was more obvious in the degree in which
the figure was complicated and of frequent employment.</p>

<p>For convenience the subject is divided into: 1. Conventional devices.
2. Syllabaries and alphabets.</p>

<h4>PEACE.</h4>

<p>Among the North American Indians and in several parts of the world
where, as among the Indians, the hand-grasp in simple salutation has
not been found, the junction of the hands between two persons of
different tribes is the ceremonial for union and peace, and the sign for
the same concept is exhibited by the two hands of one person similarly
grasped as an invitation to, or signification of, union and peace. The
ideogram of clasped hands to indicate peace and friendship is found in
pictographs from many localities. The exhibition and presentation of
the unarmed hand may have affected the practice, but the concept of
union by linking is more apparent.</p>

The-Swan’s Winter Count, 1840-’41. Here the hands shown with fingers
extended, and therefore incapable of grasping a
weapon, are approaching each other. The different

line may only intensify the idea of a treaty resulting
in peace, but perhaps recognizes the fact that
the Omaha (on the left) and Dakota belong to
the same Siouan stock. The marks on the Omaha

He explains that the five were killed in an encounter
with the Pawnees. The capote or headdress, always
but not exclusively worn by Dakota war parties, is
shown, and is the special symbol of war as also given
in several other places in the same record. The five
short vertical lines below the arrow signify that five
were killed.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 1022.&mdash;War-Eagle. Red-Cloud’s Census.
This figure shows a highly abbreviated conventional symbol.
The pipe used in the ceremonial manner explained on
page <a href="#page539">539</a> et seq. means war and not peace, and the single eagle
feather stands for the entire bird often called the war-eagle.</p>

<p>The adoption of a mat or mattress as an emblem of war or a military
expedition is discussed and illustrated, supra, p. <a href="#page553">553</a>, Fig. <a href="#page556">782</a>.</p>

<p>In the Jesuit Relation for 1606, p. 51, it is narrated that “The Huron
and Northern Algonkin chiefs, when their respective war parties met
the enemy, distributed among their warriors rods which they carried
for the purpose, and the warriors stuck them in the earth as a token
that they would not retreat any more than the rods would.”</p>

<p>In their pictographs the rods became represented by strokes which
were not only numerical, but signified warriors.</p>

<p>Fig. 1023.&mdash;Naca-haksila, Chief-Boy. From the Oglala
Roster. The large pipe held forward with the outstretched
hand is among the Oglalas the conventional
device for chief. This is explained elsewhere by the ceremonies
attendant on the raising of war parties, in which
the pipe is conspicuous. That the human figure is a boy
is indicated by the shortness of the hair and the legs.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1024.</span>&mdash;War Chief. Passamaquoddy.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 1024, drawn by a Passamaquoddy Indian, shows
the manner of representing a war chief by that tribe:</p>

<p>It signifies a chief with 300 braves. The relative magnitude
of the leading human figure indicates his rank. In this particular
compare Figs. <a href="#page174">137</a>, <a href="#page175">138</a>, and <a href="#page181">142</a>. The device is common in the
Egyptian glyphs.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Worsnop, op. cit., makes the following
remarks about a similar device
in Australia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At Chasm island, in the Gulf of Carpentaria,
indenting Australia, the third person of a file
of thirty-two painted on the rock was twice
the height of the others, and held in his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="page653" id="page653">[653]</a></span>
something resembling the waddy, or wooden sword, of the natives of Port Jackson,
and was probably intended to represent a chief. They could not as with us, indicate
superiority by clothing or ornament, since they wear none of any kind, and
therefore, with the addition of a weapon similar to the ancients, they seem to have
made superiority of persons the principal emblem of superior power, of which, indeed
power is usually a consequence in the very early stages of society.</p></div>

<p>The exhibition of horns as a part of the head dress, or pictorially
displayed as growing from the head, is generally among the tribes of
Indians an emblem of power or chieftancy. It is distinctly so asserted
by Schoolcraft, vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, p. 409, as regards the Ojibwa, and by Lafitau,
vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>, 21, both authors presenting illustrations. The same concept was
ancient and general in the eastern hemisphere. The images of gods
and heads of kings were thus adorned, as at a later day were the crests
of the dukes of Brittany. Some writers have suggested that this symbol
was taken from the crescent moon, others that it referred to the vigor
of the bull. Col. Marshall (<i>a</i>), however, gives an instance of special
derivation. He says that the Todas, when idle, involuntarily twist
and split branches of twigs and pieces of cane into the likeness of
buffalo horns, because they dream of buffalo, live on and by it, and
their whole religion is based on the care of the cow.</p>

<p>Fig. 1025 is taken from the Winter Count of Battiste Good for the

American-Horse’s Winter
Count, 1805-’06. This was perhaps
their meeting with the
Lewis and Clarke expedition.
The curved line is drawn to
represent the council lodge, which they made by
opening several tipis and uniting them at their sides to form a semicircle.
The small dashes are for the people. This is a compromise between the
Indian and the European mode of designating an official assemblage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When they have lost any men on the field of battle they paint the men with the
legs in the air and without heads, and in the same number as they have lost; and to
denote the tribe to which they belonged, they paint the animal of the tribe of the deceased
on its back, the paws in the air, and if it be the chief of the party that is
dead, the animal is without the head.</p>

<p>If there be only wounded, they paint a broken gun which, however, is connected
with the stock, or even an arrow, and to denote where they have been wounded, they
paint the animal of the tribe to which the wounded belong with an arrow piercing
the part in which the wound is located; and if it be a gunshot they make the mark
of the ball on the body of a different color.</p></div>

draw the same character for “man” simply.</p>

made red strokes with the figure of a man drawn in black with bandaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="page661" id="page661">[661]</a></span>

it may be conjectured that it ideographically meant death&mdash;the

<p>Fig. 1078.&mdash;Shot-in-front-the-lodge. Red-Cloud’s Census. Without
explanation derived from the context this
figure would not be understood. The right hand
character means several bows united.
Between these and the tipi is the usual device
for blood flowing vertically downwards,
meaning a fatal shot, and the device displayed
horizontally and touching the tipi
means that the man shot belonged to that
tipi or lodge, in front of which he was shot.</p>

<h4>COMING RAIN.</h4>

<p>Mr. Keam in his MS. describes Fig. 1079 as two forms of
the symbol of Aloseka, which is the bud of the squash. The
form seen in the upper part of the figure, drawn in profile,
is also used by the Moki to typify the east peak of the
San Francisco mountains, the birthplace of the Aloseka;
when the clouds circle, it presages the coming rain. In
the rock carvings the curving profile is further conventionalized
into straight lines and assumes the lower form.</p>

<p>The collection of characters given in Figs. 1080 and 1081 are selected
from a list published by Maj. C. R. Conder (<i>b</i>). That list includes all
the Hittite designs distinctly deciphered which are so far known, and
they are divided by the author into two plates, one giving the “Hittite
emblems,” as he calls them, “of known sound,” and which are all compared
with the Cypriote, and some with the cuneiform, Egyptian, and
other characters; and the other comprising the “Hittite emblems of
uncertain sound.” The collection is highly suggestive for comparison
of the significance of many forms commonly appearing in several lands
and also as a study of conventionalizing. In these respects its presentation
renders it unnecessary to dwell as much as would otherwise
be required upon the collections of Egyptian and cuneiform characters,
with which students are more familiar and which teach substantially
the same lessons.</p>

<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">SYLLABARIES AND ALPHABETS.</span></h3>

<p>It is worthy of observation that the Greeks used the same word,
γράφειν, to mean drawing and writing, suggesting their early identity.
Drawing was the beginning of writing, and writing was a conventionalized
drawing. The connection of both with gesture signs has been
noticed above. A gesture sign is a significant but evanescent motion,
and a drawing is produced by a motion which leaves significant marks.
When man became proficient in oral language, and desired to give permanence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page665" id="page665">[665]</a></span>
to his thoughts, he first resorted to the designs of picture-writing,
already known and used, to express the sounds of his speech.</p>

<p>The study of different systems of writing&mdash;such as the Chinese, the
Assyrian, and the Egyptian&mdash;shows that no people ever invented an
arbitrary system of writing or originated a true alphabet by any fixed
predetermination. All the known graphic systems originated in picture-writing.
All have passed through the stage of conventionalism to
that commonly called the hieroglyphic, while from the latter, directly
or after an intermediate stage, sprang the syllabary which used modifications
of the old ideograms and required a comparatively small
number of characters. Finally, among the more civilized of ancient
races the alphabet was gradually introduced as a simplification of the
syllabary, and still further reduced the necessary characters.</p>

<p>The old ideograms were, or may be supposed to have been, intelligible
to all peoples without regard to their languages. In this respect they
resembled the Arabic and Roman numerals which are understood
by many nations of diverse speech when written while the sound of
the words figured by them is unintelligible. Their number, however,
was limited only by the current ideas, which might become infinite.
Also each idea was susceptible of preservation in different forms, and
might readily be misinterpreted; therefore the simplicity and precision
of alphabetic writing amply compensated for its exclusiveness.</p>

<p>The high development of pictorial writing in Mexico and Central
America is well known. Some of these peoples had commenced the
introduction of phonetics into their graphic system, especially in the
rendering of proper names, which probably also was the first step in
that direction among the Egyptians. But Prof. Cyrus Thomas (<i>b</i>)
makes the following remark upon the Maya system, which is of general
application:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is certain, and even susceptible of demonstration, that a large portion, perhaps
the majority, of the characters are symbols.</p>

<p>The more I study these characters the stronger becomes the conviction that they
have grown out of a pictographic system similar to that common among the Indians
of North America. The first step in advance appears to have been to indicate, by
characters, the gesture signs.</p></div>

<p>It is not possible now to discuss the many problems contained in the
vast amount of literature on the subject of the Mexican and Central
American writing, and it is the less necessary because much of the
literature is recent and easily accessible. With regard to the Indian
tribes north of Mexico, it is not claimed that more than one system of
characters resembling a syllabary or alphabet was invented by any of
them. The Cherokee alphabet, so called, was adopted from the Roman
by Sequoya, also called George Gist, about A. D. 1820, and was ingenious
and very valuable to the tribe, but being an imitation of an old invention
it has no interest in relation to the present topic. The same is manifestly
true regarding the Cree alphabet, which was of missionary origin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page666" id="page666">[666]</a></span>
The exception claimed is that commonly, but erroneously, called the
Micmac hieroglyphics. The characters do not partake of the nature of
hieroglyphs, and their origin is not Micmac.</p>


<h4>THE MICMAC “HIEROGLYPHICS.”</h4>

<p>The Micmac was an important tribe, occupying all of Nova Scotia,
Cape Breton island, Prince Edward island, the northern part of New
Brunswick, and the adjacent part of the province of Quebec, and ranging
over a great part of Newfoundland. According to Rev. Silas T.
Rand, op. cit., Megum is the singular form of the name which the
Micmacs use for themselves. Rev. Eugene Vetromile (<i>a</i>) translates
“Micmacs” as “secrets practicing men,” from the Delaware and old
Abnaki word <i>malike</i>, “witchcraft,” and says the name was given them
on account of their numerous jugglers; but he derives Mareschite,
which is an Abnaki division, from the same word and makes it identical
with Micmac. The French called them Souriquois, which Vetromile
translates “good canoe men.” They were also called Acadians, from
their habitat in Acadie, now Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>The first reference in literature with regard to the spontaneous use
by Indians of the characters now called the “Micmac hieroglyphs”
appears in the Jesuit Relations of the year 1652, p. 28. In the general
report of that year the work of Father Gabriel Druillettes, who had
been a missionary to the Abnaki (including under this term the Indians
of Acadia, afterwards distinguished as Micmacs), is dwelt upon in
detail. His own words, in a subordinate report, appear to have been
adopted in the general report of the Father Superior, and, translated,
are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some of them wrote out their lessons in their own manner. They made use of a
small piece of charcoal instead of a pen, and a piece of bark instead of paper. Their
characters were novel, and so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">particuliers</i> [individual or special] that one could not
know or understand the writing of the other; that is to say, that they made use of
certain marks according to their own ideas as of a local memory to preserve the
points and the articles and the maxims which they had remembered. They carried
away this paper with them to study their lesson in the repose of the night.</p></div>

<p>No further remark or description appears.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice that the abbé J. A. Maurault, (<i>a</i>) after his
citation of the above report of Father Druillettes, states in a footnote
translated as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have ourselves been witnesses of a similar fact among the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Têtes-de-Boule</span>
Indians of the River St. Maurice where we had been missionaries during three years.
We often saw during our instructions or explanations of the catechism that the Indians
traced on pieces of bark, or other objects very singular hieroglyphs. These Indians
afterward passed the larger part of the following night in studying what they
had so written, and in teaching it to their children or their brothers. The rapidity
with which they by this manner learnt their prayers was very astonishing.</p></div>

<p>The Indians called by the Abbé Maurault the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Têtes-de-Boule</span> or
Round Heads, are also known as Wood Indians, and are ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="page667" id="page667">[667]</a></span>
to have been a band of the Ojibwa, which shows a connection between
the practice of the Ojibwa and that of the Micmacs, both being of the
Algonquian stock, to mark on bark ideographic or other significant inscriptions
which would assist them to memorize what struck them as of
special interest and importance, notably religious rites. Many instances
are given in the present paper, and the spontaneous employment of
prayer sticks by other persons of the same stock is also illustrated
in Figs. <a href="#page508">715</a> and <a href="#page509">716</a>.</p>

<p>The next notice in date is by Père Chrétien Le Clercq (<i>a</i>), a member of
the Recollect order of Franciscans who landed on the coast of Gaspé
in 1675, learned the language of the Micmacs and worked with them
continuously for several years.</p>

<p>It would appear that he observed and took advantage of the pictographic
practice of the Indians, which may have been continued from
that reported by Father Druillettes a few years earlier with reference to
the same general region, or may have been a separate and independent
development in the tribe with which Father Le Clercq was most closely
connected.</p>

<p>His quaint account is translated as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our Lord inspired me with this method the second year of my mission, when,
being greatly embarrassed as to the mode in which I should teach the Indians to
pray, I noticed some children making marks on birch bark with coal, and they
pointed to them with their fingers at every word of the prayer which they pronounced.
This made me think that by giving them some form which would aid
their memory by fixed characters, I should advance much more rapidly than by
teaching on the plan of making them repeat over and over what I said. I was
charmed to know that I was not deceived, and that these characters which I had
traced on paper produced all the effect I desired, so that in a few days they learned all
their prayers without difficulty. I cannot describe to you the ardor with which these
poor Indians competed with each other in praiseworthy emulation which should be
the most learned and the ablest. It costs, indeed, much time and pains to make all
they require, and especially since I enlarged them so as to include all the prayers
of the church, with the sacred mysteries of the trinity, incarnation, baptism, penance,
and the eucharist.</p></div>

<p>There is no description whatever of the characters.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1082.</span>&mdash;Title page of Kauder’s Micmac Catechism.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The next important printed notice or appearance of the Micmac characters
is in the work of Rev. Christian Kauder, a Redemptorist missionary,
the title page of which is given in Fig. 1082. It was printed in
Vienna in 1866 and therefore was about two centuries later than the first
recorded invention of the characters. During those two centuries the
French and therefore the Roman Catholic influences had been much of
the time dormant in the habitat of the Micmacs (the enforced exodus of
the French from Acadie being about 1755). Father Kauder was one of
the most active in the renewal of the missions. He learned the Micmac
language, probably gathered together such “hieroglyphs” on rolls of
bark as had been preserved, added to them parts of the Greek and
Roman alphabet and other designs, and arranged the whole in systematic
and grammatic form. After about twenty years of work upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page668" id="page668">[668]</a></span>
them he procured their printing in Vienna. A small part of the edition,
which was the first printed, reached the Micmacs. The main part,
shipped later, was lost at sea in the transporting vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page669" id="page669">[669]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1083.</span>&mdash;The Lord’s Prayer in Micmac hieroglyphics.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 1083 shows the version of the Lord’s Prayer, published by Dr.
J. G. Shea (<i>a</i>) in his translation of Le Clercq’s First Establishment of
the Faith in New France, this and the preceding figure being taken
from the Bibliography of the Languages of the N. A. Indians by Mr.
J. C. Pilling, of the Bureau of Ethnology.</p>

<p>The publication of Father Kauder was a duodecimo in three parts:
Catechism, 144 pages; religious reflections, 109 pages; and hymnal,
208 pages. They are very seldom found bound together, and a perfect
copy of either of the parts or volumes is rare. On a careful examination
of the hieroglyphs, so called, it seems evident that on the original
substratum of Micmac designs or symbols, each of which represented
mnemonically a whole sentence or verse, a large number of arbitrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="page670" id="page670">[670]</a></span>
designs have been added to express ideas and words which were not
American, and devices were incorporated with them intended to represent
the peculiarities of the Micmac grammar as understood by Kauder,
and it would seem of a universal grammar antedating Volapük. The
explanation of these additions has never been made known. Kauder
died without having left any record or explanation of the plan by which
he attempted to convert the mnemonic characters invented by the
Indians into what may be considered an exposition of organized words
(not sounds) in grammatical form. An attempt which may be likened
to this was made by Bishop Landa in his use of the Maya characters,
and one still more in point was that of the priests in Peru, mentioned
in connection with Figs. <a href="#page672">1084</a> and <a href="#page672">1085</a>, infra.</p>

<p>The result is that in the several camps of Micmacs visited by the
present writer in Cape Breton island, Prince Edward island, and Nova
Scotia, fragments of the printed works are kept and used for religious
worship, and also many copies on various sheets and scraps of paper
have been made of similar fragments, but their use is entirely mnemonic,
as was that of their ancient bark originals. Very few of the Indians
who in one sense can “read” them currently in the Micmac language,
have any idea of the connection between any one of the characters and
the vocables of the language. When asked what a particular character
meant they were unable to answer, but would begin at the commencement
of the particular prayer or hymn, and when arrested at any point
would then for the first time be able to give the Micmac word or words
which corresponded with that character. This was not in any religious
spirit, as is mentioned by Dr. Washington Matthews, in his Mountain
Chant, Fifth Ann. Rep. Bureau of Ethnology, with reference to the
Navajo’s repeating all, if any, of the chant, but because they only knew
that way to use the script. In that use they do as is mentioned of the
Ojibwa, supra. The latter often by their bark script keep the memory
of archaic words, and the Micmac keep that of religious phrases not well
understood. A few, and very few, of the characters, which were constantly
repeated, and were specially conspicuous, were known as distinct
from the other characters by one only of the Indians examined. It
apparently had never occurred to any of them that these same characters,
which in their special mnemonic connection represented Micmac words,
could be detached from their context and by combination represent the
same words in other sentences. Therefore, the expression “reading,” used
in reference to the operation, is not strictly correct. In most cases the
recitation of the script was in a chant, and the musical air of the Roman
Catholic Church belonging to the several hymns and chants was often
imitated. The object, therefore, which has been expressed in the above
quoted accounts of Fathers Druillettes and Le Clercq had been accomplished
regarding the then extant generation of Indians two hundred
years before Father Kauder’s publication. That object was for Indians
under their immediate charge to learn in the most speedy manner certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="page671" id="page671">[671]</a></span>
formulæ of the church, by the use of which it was supposed that they
would gain salvation. The formation of an alphabet, or even a syllabary,
by which the structure of the language should be considered and
its vocal expression recorded, was not the object. It is possible that
there was an objection to the instruction of the Indians in a modern
alphabet by which they might more readily learn either French or
English, and at the same time be able to read profane literature and
thereby become perverted from the faith. These missionaries certainly
refrained, for some reason, not only from instructing the heathen
in any of the languages of civilization, but also from teaching them
the use of an alphabet for their own language.</p>

<p>It is probable that Father Kauder had some idea of reducing the
language of the Micmacs to a written form, based not upon verbal or
even syllabic notation, but upon some anomalous compromise between
their ideographic original or substratum and a grammatic superstructure.
If so, he entirely failed. The interesting point with regard to
this remarkable and unique attempt is, that there is undoubtedly a
basis of Indian designs and symbols included and occluded among the
differentiated devices in the three volumes mentioned, which arbitrarily
express thoughts and words by a false pictographic method, instead of
sentences and verses. But the change from the pictorial forms to those
adopted, if not as radical as that from the Egyptian hieroglyphs to
the Roman text, resembles that from the archaic to the modern Chinese.
Therefore it would follow that the present form of the characters is not
one which the Indians would learn more readily than an alphabet or
a syllabary, and that is the ascertained fact. At Cow bay, a Micmac
camp, about 12 miles from Halifax, an aged chief who in his boyhood
at Cape Breton island was himself instructed by Father Kauder in
these characters, explained that Kauder taught them to the boys by
drawing them on a blackboard and by repetition, very much in the
manner in which a schoolmaster in civilized countries teaches the alphabet
to children. The actual success of the Cherokees in the free
and general use of Sequoya’s Syllabary, which was not founded on
pictographs, but on signs for sounds, should be noted in this connection.</p>

<p>Among the thousands of scratchings on the Kejemkoojik rocks, many
of which were undoubtedly made by the Micmac, only two characters
were found resembling any in Kauder’s volumes, and those were common
symbols of the Roman Catholic Church, and might readily have
been made by the Frenchmen, who also certainly left scratchings there.
Altogether after careful study of the subject it is considered that the
devices in Father Kauder’s work are so intrinsically changed, both in
form and intent, from the genuine Micmac designs that they can not be
presented as examples of Indian pictography.</p>

<p>Connected with this topic is the following account in the Jesuit Relations
of 1646, p. 31, relative to the Montagnais and other Algonquians of
the St. Lawrence river, near the Saguenay: “They confess themselves
with admirable frankness; some of them carry small sticks to remind<span class="pagenum"><a name="page672" id="page672">[672]</a></span>
them of their sins; others write, after their manner, on small pieces of
bark.” This is but the application of the ideographic writing on birch
bark by the converts to the ceremonies and stories of the Christian
religion, as the same art had been long used for their aboriginal traditions.</p>

<p>Examples of pictographic work, done in a spirit similar to that above
mentioned, are given by Wiener (<i>g</i>), describing the illustrations of
which Figs. 1084 and 1085 are copies, one-fifth real size.</p>

<p>In the most distant part of Peru,
in the valley of Paucartambo,
at Sicasica, the history of the passion
of Christ was found written
in the same ideographic system
that the Indians of Ancon and
the north of the coast were acquainted
with before the conquest.
(Fig. 1084.) The drawings
were made with a pencil, probably
first dipped in a mixture of
gum and mandioc flour. This
tissue is of a dark brown and
the designs are of a very bright
red.</p>

</div>

<p>The second series, Fig. 1085,
which was found at Paucartambo,
was written in an analogous system
on old Dutch paper. The
designs are red and blue.</p>

<p>In an article by Terrien de Lacouperie (<i>f</i>) is the following condensed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page673" id="page673">[673]</a></span>
account, part of which relates to Fig. 1086, and may be compared with
the priestly inventions above mentioned:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">

</a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1086.</span>&mdash;Mo-so MS. Desgodins.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Père Desgodins was able, in 1867, to make a copy of eleven pages from a manuscript
written in hieroglyphics, and belonging to a tom-ba or tong-ba, a medicine
man among the Mo-sos. These hieroglyphics are not, properly speaking, a writing,
still less the current writing of the tribe. The sorcerers or tong-bas alone use it
when invited by the people to recite these so-called prayers, accompanied with
ceremonies and sacrifices, and also to put some spells on somebody, a specialty of
their own. They alone know how to read them and understand their meaning;
they alone are acquainted with the value of these signs, combined with the numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page674" id="page674">[674]</a></span>
of the dice and other implements of divination which they use in their witchcraft.
Therefore, these hieroglyphics are nothing else than signs more or less symbolical
and arbitrary, known to a small number of initiated who transmit their knowledge
to their eldest son and successor in their profession of sorcerers. Such is the exact
value of the Mo-so manuscripts; they are not a current and common writing; they
are hardly a sacred writing in the limits indicated above.</p>

<p>However, they are extremely important for the general theory of writing, inasmuch
as they do not pretend to show in that peculiar hieroglyphical writing any survival
of former times. According to these views, it was apparently made up for the purpose
by the tom-bas or medicine men. This would explain, perhaps, the anomalous
mixture of imperfect and bad imitations of ancient seal characters of China, pictorial
figures of animals and men, bodies and their parts, with several Tibetan and Indian
characters and Buddhist emblems.</p>

<p>It is not uninteresting to remark here that a kind of meetway or toomsah, i. e.,
priest, has been pointed out among the Kakhyens of Upper Burma. The description
is thus quoted:</p>

<p>“A formal avenue always exists as the entrance to a Kakhyen village. * * *
On each side of the broad grassy pathway are a number of bamboo posts, 4 feet high
or thereabouts, and every 10 paces or so, taller ones, with strings stretching across
the path, supporting small stars of split rattan and other emblems. There are also
certain hieroglyphics which may constitute a kind of embryo picture-writing but
are understood by none but the meetway or priest.”</p></div>


<h4>PICTOGRAPHS IN ALPHABETS.</h4>

<p>Mr. W. W. Rockhill, in Am. Anthrop., <span class="smcap lowercase">IV</span>, No. 1, p. 91, notices the
work of M. Paul Vial, missionary, etc., <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De la langue et de l’écriture indigènes
au Yûnân</span>, with the following remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Père Vial has published a study upon the undeciphered script of the Lolos of
Western China, of which the first specimen was secured some twelve years ago by
E. Colborne Baber. Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie endeavored to establish a connection
between these curious characters and the old Indian script known as the
southern Ashoka alphabet. The present, Père Vial’s, work gives them a much less
glorious origin. He says of them: “The native characters were formed without
key, without method. It is impossible to decompose them. They are written
not with the strokes of a brush, but with straight, curved, round, or angular
lines, as the shape chosen for them requires. As the representation could not be
perfect, they have stopped at something which can strike the eye or mind&mdash;form,
motion, passion, a head, a bird’s beak, a mouth, right or left, lightness or heaviness;
in short, at that portion of the object delineated which is peculiarly characteristic
of it. But all characters are not of this expressive kind; some even have no connection
with the idea they express. This anomaly has its reason. The native characters
are much less numerous than the words of the language, only about thirty per
cent. Instead of increasing the number of ideograms, the Lolos have used one for
several words. As a result of this practice the natives have forgotten the original
meaning of many of their characters.”</p></div>

<p>A summary of the original cuneiform characters, numbering one
hundred and seventy, gives many of them as recognizable sketches of
objects. The foot stands for “go,” the hand for “take,” the legs for
“run,” much as in the Egyptian and in the Maya and other American
systems. The bow, the arrow, and the sword represent war; the vase,
the copper tablet, and the brick represent manufacture; boats, sails,
huts, pyramids, and many other objects are used as devices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page675" id="page675">[675]</a></span></p>

<p>W. St. Chad Boscawen (<i>a</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Man’s earliest ventures in the art of writing were, as we are well aware, of a purely
pictorial nature, and even to this day such a mode of ideography can be seen among
some of the Indian tribes. * * * There is no reasonable doubt but that all the
principal systems of paleography now in vogue had their origin at some remote period
in this pictorial writing. In so primitive a center as Babylonia we should naturally
expect to find such a system had been in vogue, and in this we are not disappointed.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<span class="subhead">SPECIAL COMPARISONS.</span></h2>


<p>The utility of the present work depends mainly upon the opportunity
given by the various notes and illustrations collected for students
to make their own comparisons and deductions. This chapter
is intended to assist in that study by presenting some groups of
comparisons which have seemed to possess special interest. For that
reason descriptions and illustrations are collected here which logically
belong to other headings.</p>

<p>Many of the pictographs discussed and illustrated in this chapter
and in the one following are the representation of animals and other
natural objects. It would therefore seem that they could be easily
identified, but in fact the modes of representation of the same object
among the several peoples differed, and when conventionalizing has
also become a factor the objects may not be recognized without knowledge
of the typical style. Sometimes there was apparently no attempt
at the imitation of natural objects, but marks were used, such as points,
lines, circles, and other geometric forms. These were combined in
diverse modes to express concepts and record events. Those marks
and combinations originated in many centers and except in rare
instances of “natural” ideograms those of one people would not correspond
with those of other peoples unless by conveyance or imitation.
Typical styles therefore appear also in this class of pictographs and,
when established, all typical styles afford some indication with regard to
the peoples using them.</p>

<p>This chapter is divided under the headings of: 1. Typical Style.
2. Homomorphs and Symmorphs. 3. Composite forms. 4. Artistic skill
and methods.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">TYPICAL STYLE.</span></h3>

<p>Fig. 1088 is presented as a type of eastern Algonquian petroglyphs.
It is a copy of the “Hamilton picture rock,” contributed by Mr. J. Sutton
Wall, of Monongahela city, Pennsylvania. The drawings are on
a sandstone rock, on the Hamilton farm, 6 miles southeast from Morgantown,
West Virginia. The turnpike passes over the south edge of
the rock.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wall furnishes the following description of the characters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>a</i>, outline of a turkey; <i>b</i>, outline of a panther; <i>c</i>, outline of a rattlesnake; <i>d</i>, outline
of a human form; <i>e</i>, a “spiral or volute;” <i>f</i>, impression of a horse foot; <i>g</i>,
impression of a human foot; <i>h</i>, outline of the top portion of a tree or branch; <i>i</i>, impression
of a human hand; <i>j</i>, impression of a bear’s forefoot, but lacks the proper
number of toe marks; <i>k</i>, impression of two turkey tracks; <i>l</i>, has some appearance of
a hare or rabbit, but lacks the corresponding length of ears; <i>m</i>, impression of a
bear’s hindfoot, but lacks the proper number of toe marks; <i>n</i>, outline of infant
human form, with two arrows in the right hand; <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, two cup-shaped depressions;
<i>q</i>, outline of the hind part of an animal; <i>r</i> might be taken to represent the impression
of a horse’s foot were it not for the line bisecting the outer curved line; <i>s</i> represent
buffalo and deer tracks.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page678" id="page678">[678]</a></span></p>

<p>The turkey <i>a</i>, the rattlesnake <i>c</i>, the rabbit <i>l</i>, and the “footprints”
<i>j</i>, <i>m</i>, and <i>q</i>, are specially noticeable as typical characters in Algonquian
pictography.</p>

<p>Mr. P. W. Sheafer furnishes, in his Historical Map of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, 1875, a sketch of a pictograph on the Susquehanna river,
Pennsylvania, below the dam at Safe Harbor, part of which is reproduced
in Fig. 1089. This appears to be purely Algonquian, and has
more resemblance to Ojibwa characters than any other petroglyph in
the eastern United States yet noted.</p>

<p>See also Figs. <a href="#page107">70</a>, et seq., supra, under the heading of Pennsylvania,
as showing excellent types of eastern Algonquian petroglyphs and
resembling those on the Dighton rock.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 1090.&mdash;Algonquian petroglyphs. Cunningham’s island, Lake Erie.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 1090 is reproduced from Schoolcraft (<i>p</i>), and is a copy taken in
1851 of an inscription sculptured on a rock on the south side of Cunningham’s
island, Lake Erie. Mr. Schoolcraft’s explanation, given in
great detail, is fanciful. It is perhaps only necessary to explain that
the dotted lines are intended to divide the partially obliterated from
the more distinct portions of the glyph. The central part is the most
obscure.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that this petroglyph is in some respects similar
in general style to those before given as belonging to the eastern Algonquian
type, but is still more like some of the representations of the
Dighton rock inscription, one of them being Fig. <a href="#page086">49</a>, supra, and others,
which it still more closely resembles in the mode of drawing human
figures, are in the copies of Dighton rock on Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page763">LIV</a></span>, Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXII</span>. In
some respects this Cunningham’s island glyph occupies a typical position
intermediate between the eastern and western Algonquian.</p>

<p>A good type of western Algonquian petroglyphs was discovered by
the party of Capt. William A. Jones (<i>b</i>), in 1873, with an illustration
here reproduced as Fig. 1091, in which the greater number of the characters
are shown, about one-fifth real size.</p>

</div>

<p>An abstract of his description is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>* * * Upon a nearly vertical wall of the yellow sandstones, just back of Murphy’s
ranch, a number of rude figures had been chiseled, apparently at a period not
very recent, as they had become much worn. * * * No certain clue to the connected
meaning of this record was obtained, although Pínatsi attempted to explain
it when the sketch was shown to him some days later by Mr. F. W. Bond, who copied
the inscriptions from the rocks. The figure on the left, in the upper row, somewhat
resembles the design commonly used to represent a shield, with the greater part of
the ornamental fringe omitted, perhaps worn away in the inscription. We shall
possibly be justified in regarding the whole as an attempt to record the particulars of
a fight or battle which once occurred in this neighborhood. Pínatsi’s remarks conveyed
the idea to Mr. Bond that he understood the figure [the second in the upper
line] to signify cavalry, and the six figures [three in the middle of the upper line,
as also the three to the left of the lower line] to mean infantry, but he did not
appear to recognize the hieroglyphs as the copy of any record with which he was
familiar.</p></div>

<p>Throughout the Wind river country of Wyoming many petroglyphs<span class="pagenum"><a name="page679" id="page679">[679]</a></span>
have been found and others reported by the Shoshoni Indians, who
say that they are the work of the “Pawkees,” as they call the Blackfeet,
or, more properly, Satsika, an Algonquian tribe which formerly
occupied that region, and their general style bears strong resemblance
to similar carvings found in the eastern portion of the United States,
in regions known to have been occupied by other tribes of the Algonquian
linguistic stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page680" id="page680">[680]</a></span></p>

<p>The four specimens of Algonquian petroglyphs presented here in
Figs. 1088-91 and those referred to, show gradations in type. In
connection with them reference may be made to the numerous Ojibwa
bark records in this work; the Ottawa pipestem, Fig. <a href="#page530">738</a>; and they
may be contrasted with the many Dakota, Shoshoni, and Innuit drawings
also presented.</p>

<p>The petroglyphs found scattered throughout the states and territories
embraced within the area bounded by the Rocky mountains on
the east and the Sierra Nevada on the west, and generally south of
the forty-eighth degree of latitude, are markedly similar in the class of
objects represented and the general
style of their delineation, without reference
to their division into pecked
or painted characters; also in many
instances the sites selected for petroglyphic
display are of substantially
the same character. This type has
been generally designated as the
Shoshonean, though many localities
abounding in petroglyphs of the type
are now inhabited by tribes of other
linguistic stocks.</p>

<p>Mr. G. K. Gilbert, of the U. S.
Geological Survey, has furnished a
small collection of drawings of Shoshonean
petroglyphs from Oneida,
Idaho, shown in Fig. <a href="#page077">39</a>, supra.</p>

<p>Five miles northwest from this
locality and one-half mile east from
Marsh creek is another group of
characters on basalt bowlders, apparently
totemic, and drawn by Shoshoni.
A copy of these, also contributed by Mr. Gilbert, is given in
Fig. 1092.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. I. C. Russell, of the U. S. Geological Survey, has furnished
drawings of rude pictographs at Black Rock spring, Utah, represented
in Fig. 1093. Some of the other characters not represented in the
figure consist of several
horizontal lines, placed
one above another, above
which are a number of
spots, the whole appearing
like a numerical record
having reference to the
figure alongside, which
resembles, to a slight extent,
a melon with tortuous
vines and stems. The
left-hand upper figure
suggests the masks shown
in Fig. <a href="#page505">713</a>.</p>

Utah.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Gilbert Thompson,
of the U. S. Geological
Survey, has discovered
pictographs at Fool creek
canyon, Utah, shown in
Fig. 1094, which strongly
resemble those still made
by the Moki of Arizona.
Several characters are identical with those last mentioned, and represent
human figures, one of which is drawn to represent a man, shown by
a cross, the upper arm of which is attached
to the perinæum. These are all drawn in red
color and were executed at three different
periods. Other neighboring pictographs
are pecked and unpainted, while others are
both pecked and painted.</p>

<p>Both of these pictographs from Utah may
be compared with the Moki pictographs from
Oakley springs, Arizona, copied in Fig. <a href="#page748">1261</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. G. W. Barnes, of San Diego, California,
has kindly furnished sketches of pictographs
prepared for him by Mrs. F. A. Kimball,
of National city, California, which were
copied from records 25 miles northeast of
the former city. Many of them found upon
the faces of large rocks are almost obliterated,
though sufficient remains to permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="page682" id="page682">[682]</a></span>
tracing. The only color used appears to be red ocher. Many of the
characters, as noticed upon the drawings, closely resemble those in New
Mexico, at Ojo de Benado, south of Zuñi, and in the canyon leading
from the canyon at Stewart’s ranch, to the Kanab creek canyon, Utah.
This is an indication of the habitat of the Shoshonean stock apart from
the linguistic evidence with which it agrees.</p>

<p>From the numerous illustrations furnished of petroglyphs found in
Owens valley, California, reference is here made to Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page058">II</a></span> <i>a</i>, Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page058">III</a></span> <i>h</i>,
and Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page058">VII</a></span> <i>a</i> as presenting suggestive similarity to the Shoshonean
forms above noted, and apparently connecting them with others in New
Mexico, Arizona, Sonora, and Central and South America.</p>

<p>Mr. F. H. Cushing (<i>a</i>) figured three petroglyphs, now reproduced in
Figs. 1095 and 1096, from Arizona, and referred to them in connection
with figurines found in the ruined city of Los Muertos, in the Salado
valley, as follows:</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beneath the floor of the first one of these huts which we excavated, near the
ranch of Mr. George Kay Miller, were discovered, disposed precisely as would be a
modern sacrifice of the kind in Zuñi, the paraphernalia of a Herder’s sacrifice,
namely, the paint line, encircled, perforated medicine cup, the Herder’s amulet stone
of chalcedony, and a group of at least fifteen remarkable figurines. The figurines
alone, of the articles constituting this sacrifice, differed materially from those which
would occur in a modern Zuñi “New Year Sacrifice” of the kind designed to propitiate
the increase and prosperity of its herds. While in Zuñi these figurines invariably
represent sheep (the young of sheep mainly; mostly also females), the figurines
in the hut at “Los Guanacos,” as I named the place, represented with rare fidelity
* * * some variety, I should suppose, of the auchenia or llama of South America.</p>

<p>Summing up the evidence presented by the occurrence of numerous “bola stones”
in these huts and within the cities; by the remarkably characteristic forms of these
figurines; by the traditional statement of modern Zuñis regarding “small hairy
animals” possessed by their ancestors, no less than by the statements of Marcus
Nizza, Bernal Diaz, and other Spanish writers to the same effect, and adding to this
sum the facts presented in sundry ritualistic pictographs, I concluded, very boldly,
* * * that the ancient Pueblos-Shiwians, or Aridians, * * * must have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page683" id="page683">[683]</a></span>
domesticated a North American variety of the auchenia more nearly resembling, it
would seem, the guanaco of South America than the llama.</p></div>

<p>It is ascertained that the petroglyphs copied by Mr. Cushing as
above are pecked upon basaltic rock in the northern face of Maricopa
mountains, near Telegraph pass, south of Phœnix, Arizona.</p>

<p>The following information is obtained
from Dr. H. Ten Kate (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In several localities in the sierra in the
peninsula of California and Sonora are rocks
painted red. These paintings are quite rude
and are inferior to many of the pictographs
of the North American Indians. Figs. 1097
and 1098 were found at Rincon de S. Antonio.
The right-hand division of Fig. 1097 is
a complete representation, and the figures copied appear on the stone in the order in
which they are here given. The left-hand division of the same figure represents only
the most distinct objects, selected from among a large number of others, very similar,
which cover a block of marble several meters in height. The object in the upper
left-hand corner of Fig. 1097 measures 20 to 21 centimeters; the others are represented
in proportion.</p></div>

<p>Dr. F. von Hochstetter (<i>b</i>) writing of New Zealand, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The dwellings of the chiefs at Ohinemutu are surrounded with inclosures of pole
fences, and the Whares and Wharepunis, some of them exhibiting very fine specimens
of the Maori order of architecture, are ornamented with grotesque wood carvings.
Fig. 1100 is an illustration of some of them. The gable figure with the lizard
having six feet and two heads is very remarkable. The human figures are not idols,
but are intended to represent departed sires of the present generation.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tiki. At Raroera Pah, New Zealand. From Wood’s Natural History, page 180.
Of this he says: “This gigantic tiki stands, together with several others, near the
tomb of the daughter of Te Whero-Whero, and, like the monument which it seems
to guard, is one of the finest examples of native carving to be found in New Zealand.
The precise object of the tiki is uncertain, but the protruding tongue of the upper
figure seems to show that it is one of the numerous defiant statues which abound in
the islands. The natives say that the lower figure represents Maui the Auti who,
according to Maori tradition, fished up the islands from the bottom of the sea.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Bransford (<i>b</i>) gives an illustration, copied here as the left-hand
character of Fig. 1102, with the description of the site, viz: “On a hillside<span class="pagenum"><a name="page686" id="page686">[686]</a></span>
on the southern end of the island of Ometepec, Nicaragua, about
a mile and a half east of Point San Ramon.” On a rough, irregular
stone of basalt, projecting 3 feet above ground,
was the following figure on the south side:</p>

<p>The same authority gives on page 66, from the
same island and neighborhood, the illustration
copied as the right-hand character of the same

<p>By comparing some of the New Mexican, Zuñi, and Pueblo drawings
with the above figure the resemblance is obvious. This is most
notable in the outline of the square abdomen and the widespread legs.</p>

<p>Most of these figures so strongly resemble some from New Mexico,

<p>In the strange combination that surmounts it, <i>a</i>, there are seen at the lower part
two figures resembling the eyes of jaguars, but asymmetric. Still the difference is
apparent rather than real. These eyes are always formed of three circumferences,
the central one being at times replaced by a point, as in the eye at the left; the one
at the right shows its three circumferences, but the outermost is continuous with
the rest of the drawing. The two eyes are joined together by superposed arches, the
smallest of which touches only the left eye, while the larger one, which is not in
contact with the left eye, forms the circumference of the right eye. The whole is
surrounded by 34 rays, pretty nearly of the same size, except one, which is larger.
Is there question of a jaguar’s head seen from in front with its bristling mane, or is
it a sunrise? All conjecture is superfluous, and it is useless to search for the interpretation
of these figures, whose value, entirely conventional, is known only by those
who invented them.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page688" id="page688">[688]</a></span>
<p>In <i>b</i> of the same pictograph, alongside of a tangle of various figures, always formed
of geometric lines, we distinguished, at the left, three points; in the middle a collection
of lines representing a fish. Let us note, finally, the dots which, as in the
preceding case, run out from certain lines.</p>

<p>The design of <i>c</i>, while quite as complex, has quite another arrangement. At the
left we see again the figure of the circumferences surrounding a dot, and these are
surmounted by a series of triangles; at the bottom there are two little curves
terminated by dots. At <i>d</i> two analogous objects are represented; they may be what
Humboldt took to be arms or household implements.</p></div>

<p>In the above figure, the uppermost character, <i>a</i>, is similar to various
representations of the “sky,” as depicted upon the birch-bark midē'
records of the Ojibwa. The lower characters are similar to several
examples presented under the Shoshonean types, particularly to those
in Owens valley, California.</p>

<p>The rock on which the petroglyph is carved is 41 kilometers WSW. of Caracas,
and 27 kilometers almost due north of La Victoria, in the coast mountains of Venezuela.
The petroglyph is found on two large stones lying side by side and leaning
against other blocks of leptinite, though resembling sandstone. The length of the
two stones is 3.5 m., their height 2 m. The stones lie beside the road from the colony
of Tovar to La Maya, on the border of a clearing somewhat inclined southward not
far from the woods. The surface is turned south. Concerning the meaning of the
very fragmentary figures I can not even express a conjecture.</p></div>

<p>In the district of Inhamun, on the road from Carrapateira to Cracará, at a distance
of half a league, following a footpath which branches off to the left, is a small
lake called Arneiros, near which is a heap of round and long stones; on one of the
round ones is an inscription, here given in the order in which the figures appear, on
the face toward the north, engraved with a pointed instrument, the characters being

<p>From a rock which is more than 40 meters in height, a large mass has been detached
leaving a greater inclination of 10 meters. This incline, together with the
wall formed by the detached portion, constitutes a sheltered place which was used
by the Indians as a resting place for their dead.</p>

<p>On the walls of this grotto are figures engraved in the stone and painted with
“indelible” colors in red and black. It would seem that the Indians had engraved
in these figures the history of the tribe. The designs are as follows:</p>

<p>A human figure with ornaments of feathers on the head and neck; a palm tree
rudely engraved and painted; a number of circular holes, 24 or more or less, in a
straight line; a circle with a diameter of 15 inches, having dentated lines on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page690" id="page690">[690]</a></span>
edge; two concentric circles resembling a clock face, with 60 divisions; immediately
following this the figure of an idol, and various marks all painted in a very firm black;
a figure of the sun with a +; a T; six more circles; a human hand and foot well
carved, etc. In the wall are fragments of bones.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Ladisláu Netto (<i>c</i>) gives an account of characters copied from the
inscriptions of Cachoeira Savarete, in the valley of the Rio Negro, here
reproduced as Fig. 1109. They represent men and animals, concentric
circles, double spirals, and other figures of indefinite form. The design
in the left hand of the middle line evidently represents a group of men
gathered and drawn up like soldiers in a platoon.</p>

<p>The same authority, p. 552, furnishes characters copied from rocks
near the villa of Moura in the valley of the Rio Negro, here reproduced
as Fig. 1110. They represent a series of figures on which Dr. Netto
remarks as follows:</p>

<p>It is singular how frequent are these figures of circles two by two, one of which
seems to simulate one of the meanders that in a measure represent the form of the
Buddhic cross. This character, represented by the double cross, is very common in
many American inscriptions. It probably signifies some idea which has nothing to
do with that of nandyavarta.</p></div>

the banks of the Rio Negro, from
Moura to the city of Mañaus, some

believes to represent a crowned
chief, having by his side a figure
which may represent either the sun
or the moon in motion, but which,
were it carved by civilized men,
would suggest nothing more remarkable
than a large compass.</p>

<p>The same authority, p. 553, presents characters copied from stones
on the banks of the Rio Negro, Brazil, here reproduced as Fig. 1112.</p>

<p>They are rather sketches or vague tracings and attempts at drawing
than definite characters. The human heads found in most of the figures
observed at this locality resemble the heads
carved in the inscriptions of Central America
and on the banks of the Colorado river.
The left-hand character, which here appears
to be simply a rude drawing of a nose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page692" id="page692">[692]</a></span>
the eyes belonging to a human face, may be compared with the so-called
Thunderbird from Washington, contributed by Rev. Dr. Eels

on it, the first seen of that character.</p></div>

<p>He further says:</p>

<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">HOMOMORPHS AND SYMMORPHS.</span></h3>

<p>It has already been mentioned that characters substantially the
same, or homomorphs, made by one set of people, have a different
signification among others. The class of homomorphs may also embrace
the cases common in gesture signs, and in picture writing, similar
to the homophones in oral language, where the same sound has several
meanings among the same people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page693" id="page693">[693]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be very remarkable if precisely the same character were not
used by different or even the same persons or bodies of people with
wholly distinct significations. The graphic forms for objects and ideas
are much more likely to be coincident than sound is for similar expressions,
yet in all oral languages the same precise sound, sometimes but
not always distinguished by different literation, is used for utterly
diverse meanings. The first conception of different objects could not
have been the same. It has been found, indeed, that the homophony
of words and the homomorphy of ideographic pictures is noticeable in
opposite significations, the conceptions arising from the opposition
itself. The same sign and the same sound may be made to convey different
ideas by varying the expression, whether facial or vocal, and by
the manner accompanying their delivery. Pictographs likewise may
be differentiated by modes and mutations of drawing. The differentiation
in picturing or in accent is a subsequent and remedial step not
taken until after the confusion had been observed and had become inconvenient.
Such confusion and contradiction would only be eliminated
from pictography if it were far more perfect than is any spoken language.</p>

<p>This heading, for convenience, though not consistently with its definition,
may also include those pictographs which convey different ideas
and are really different in form of execution as well as in conception,
yet in which the difference in form is so slight as practically to require
attention and discrimination. Examples are given below in this section,
and others may be taken from the closely related sign-language,
one group of which may now be mentioned.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 272px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1115.</span>&mdash;Tree.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The sign used by the Dakota, Hidatsa, and several
other tribes for “tree” is made by holding the right hand
before the body, back forward, fingers and thumb separated;
then pushing it slightly upward, Fig. 1115; that
for “grass” is the same, made near the ground; that for
“grow” is made like “grass,” though, instead of holding
the back of the hand near the ground, the hand is pushed
upward in an interrupted manner, Fig. 1116. For
“smoke” the hand (with the back down, fingers pointing
upward as in grow) is then thrown upward several
times from the same place instead of continuing the
whole motion upward. Frequently the fingers are thrown
forward from under the thumb with each successive upward
motion. For “fire” the hand is employed as in the
gesture for smoke, but the motion is frequently more
waving, and in other cases made higher from the ground.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1116.</span>&mdash;Grow.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Symmorphs, a term suggested by the familiar “synonym,”
are designs not of the same form, but which are
used with the same significance or so nearly the same as
to have only a slight shade of distinction and which sometimes
are practically interchangeable. The comprehensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="page694" id="page694">[694]</a></span>
and metaphorical character of pictographs renders more of them
interchangeable than is the case with words; still, like words, some
pictographs with essential resemblance of meaning have partial and
subordinate differences made by etymology or usage. Doubtless the
designs are purposely selected to delineate the most striking outlines
of an object or the most characteristic features of an action; but different
individuals and likewise different bodies of people would often
disagree in the selection of those outlines and features. In an attempt
to invent an ideographic, not an iconographic, design for “bird,” any
one of a dozen devices might have been agreed upon with equal appropriateness,
and, in fact, a number have been so selected by several
individuals and tribes, each one, therefore, being a symmorph of the
other. Gesture language gives another example in the signs for
“deer,” designated by various modes of expressing fleetness, also by his
gait when not in rapid motion, by the shape of his horns, by the color
of his tail, and sometimes by combinations of those characteristics.
Each of these signs and of the pictured characters corresponding with
them may be indefinitely abbreviated and therefore create indefinite
diversity. Some examples appropriate to this line of comparison are
now presented.</p>


<h4>SKY.</h4>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1117.</span>&mdash;Sky.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Indian gesture sign for sky, heaven, is generally made by passing
the index from east to west across the zenith. This curve is apparent
in the Ojibwa pictograph, the left-hand character of Fig. 1117, reported
in Schoolcraft (<i>q</i>), and is abbreviated in the Egyptian character with
the same meaning, the middle character of the same figure, from Champollion
(<i>e</i>). A simpler form of the Ojibwa picture sign for sky is the
right-hand character of the same figure, from Copway (<i>h</i>).</p>

<p>The common Indian gesture sign for sun is: Right
hand closed, the index and thumb curved, with tips touching,
thus approximating a circle, and held toward the sky,
the position of the fingers of the hand forming a circle
as is shown in Fig. 1119. Two of the Egyptian characters
for sun, the left-hand upper characters of Fig. 1120
are the common conception of the disk. The rays emanating
from the whole disk appear in the two adjoining
characters on the same figure, taken from the rock etchings of the
Moki pueblos in Arizona. From the same locality are the two remaining
characters in the same figure, which may be distinguished from
several similar etchings for “star,” Fig. <a href="#page697">1129</a>, infra, by their showing
some indication of a face, the latter being absent in the characters
denoting “star.”</p>

character of Fig. 1121, taken from Schoolcraft (<i>r</i>). The

the fourth character of that figure, from Champollion, Dict.,

the Kwakiutl Indians in Alert bay, British Columbia, which represents
the sun surrounded by wooden
rays. A simpler form is seen
in the right character of the
same figure where the face of
the sun is also fastened to the
top of a pole. The author, Dr.
Boas, states that Fig. 1125 is the sun mask used by the same gens in
their dance. This presents another mode in which the common symbolic
connection of the eagle (the beak of which bird is apparently
shown) with the sun is indicated.</p>

</div>

<p>An Indian gesture sign for “sunrise,” “morning,” is: Forefinger of
right hand crooked to represent half of the sun’s disk and pointed or extended
to the left, slightly elevated. In this connection it may be noted
that when the gesture is carefully made in open country the pointing
would generally be to the east, and the body turned so that its left
would be in that direction. In a room in a city, or under circumstances
where the points of the compass are not specially attended to, the left
side supposes the east, and the gestures relating to sun, day, etc., are
made with such reference. The half only of the disk represented in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page698" id="page698">[698]</a></span>
the above gesture appears in the Moki pueblo drawings for morning
and sunrise.</p>

<p>J. B. Dunbar (<i>b</i>), in The Pawnee Indians, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As an aid to the memory the Pawnees frequently made use of notches cut in a
stick or some similar device for the computation of nights (for days were counted
by nights), or even of months and years. Pictographically a day or daytime was
represented by a six or eight pointed star as a symbol of the sun. A simple cross
(a star) was a symbol of a night and a crescent represented a moon or lunar month.</p></div>

<p>A common Indian gesture for
day is when the index and thumb
form a circle (remaining fingers
closed) and are passed from east to
west.</p>

indicate either day or month (both these gestures
having the same execution), the course of
the sun or moon being represented perhaps
in mere contradistinction to the vertical line,

<p>Connected with this topic is the following extract from Virgil’s
Æneis, Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span>, 429:</p>

<span class="i0">
Tres imbris torti radios, tres nubis aquosæ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Addiderant, rutili tres ignis et alitis austri.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The “radii” are the forks or spikes by which lightning is designated,
especially on medals. It
consisted of twelve
wreathed spikes or darts
extended like the radii of
a circle. The wings denote
the lightning’s rapid
motion and the spikes or
darts its penetrating
quality. The four different
kinds of spikes refer to
the four seasons. The “tres imbristorti radii” or the three spikes of
hail, are the winter when hail storms abound. The “tres nubis aquosæ
radii,” the three spikes of a watery cloud, denote the spring. The
“tres rutili ignis radii,” the three spikes of sparkling fire, are the summer
when lightning is frequent and the “tres alitis austri radii,” or
the three spikes of winged wind, are for autumn with its many wind
storms.</p>

<p>The representation of a headless body does not always denote death.
An example is given in Fig. 1159, <i>a</i>, taken from an ivory drill-bow in
the collection of the Alaska Commercial Company, of San Francisco,
California. It was made by the Aigaluxamut natives of Alaska. As
the explanation gives no suggestion of a fatal casualty, the concept
may be that the hunter got lost or “lost his head,” according to the
colloquial phrase.</p>

<p>The figures of men in a canoe are represented by the Kiatéxamut
Innuit of Alaska, as shown in the same figure, <i>b</i>. The right-hand upward
stroke represents the bow of the boat, while the two lines below<span class="pagenum"><a name="page704" id="page704">[704]</a></span>
the horizontal stroke denote the paddles used by the men, who are
shown as the first and second upward strokes above the canoe; in the

ivory drill-bow (U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 44398) from Cape Nome, Alaska.
The second pair closely resemble forms of the thunder-bird as drawn

drill-bow obtained at Port Clarence, Alaska, by Dr. T. H. Bean, of the

appendages on the arms may indicate the garment worn by some of
the Kenai or other inland Athabascan Indians of Alaska.</p>

speed and the power of superior knowledge by
exaltation to the regions of the air, being, in his opinion,
a combination of bird and man.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that some Ojibwa recently examined regard the
character merely as a human figure with outstretched
arms, and fringes pendent therefrom.
It has, also, a strong resemblance to some of the
figures in the Lone-Dog Winter Counts (those for
1854-’55 and 1866-’67, pages <a href="#page283">283</a> and <a href="#page285">285</a>, respectively),

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a conventional design of dragon flies, and is often found
among rock etchings throughout the plateau [Arizona]. The
dragon flies have always been held in great veneration by the
Mokis and their ancestors, as they have been often sent by
Oman to reopen springs which Muingwa had destroyed and to confer other benefits
upon the people.</p>

<p>This form of the figure, with little vertical lines added to the transverse lines,
connects the Batolatci with the Ho-bo-bo emblems. The youth who was sacrificed
and translated by Ho-bo-bo reappeared a long time afterwards, during a season of
great drought, in the form of a gigantic dragon fly, who led the rain clouds over the
lands of Ho-pi-tu, bringing plenteous rains.</p></div>

<p>Describing the middle character
of the figure, he says: “The figure
represents a woman. The breath
sign is displayed in the interior.
The simpler design in the right-hand
character consists of two triangles,
one upon another, and is called the ‘woman’s head and body.’”</p>

their skin. We ourselves, on examining these figures with legs and arms spread
out, thought that they were meant for frogs, but the Indians told us that that was
their manner of representing man.</p></div>

one-seventh of the actual size. The descriptions are condensed.

which are stitched together behind and attached to a pole, short at top,
and projecting to a greater length downwards. On the front is a slightly
sketched design in red and black lines, while a winding or undulating
border usually runs around the sides. Nearly all the space within this
border is occupied by a human figure surrounded by isolated symbols or
ornaments. The head and features of the conventionalized figure is out
of all proportion to the small body, which is often merely suggested by
a few strokes.</p>

is that the wearer is an unmarried woman. The remaining designs

pottery, being rather of a decorative character than having special
significance.</p>


<h4>HUMAN HEAD AND FACE.</h4>

<p>A large number of human faces as drawn by members of different
tribes and stocks of North American Indians appear in the present
paper. Some of them are iconographic and others are highly conventionalized.
Other examples from other regions of the world are also
presented under various headings.</p>

<p>In the present connection it may be useful to examine a series of
drawings from the prehistoric pottery of Brazil in the National Museum<span class="pagenum"><a name="page708" id="page708">[708]</a></span>
at Rio de Janeiro. Although the U. S. National Museum contains many
specimens of a similar character, some of which have been copied
and published, the Brazilian types show an instructive peculiarity in
the reduction of the face to certain main lines and finally to the eyes,
so that the latter are placed apart and independent in a symmetric
field.</p>

<p>The following Figs. 1168 to 1174 are reproduced from Dr. Ladisláu
Netto (<i>d</i>), all of them being from Brazil and from
paintings and carvings on Marajo ware.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1168.</span>&mdash;Human face.
Brazil.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 1168 shows broken lines without the aid of
curves, but gracefully attached to an instrument,
either lance or trident, which present the outline
of the contours of a face.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1169.</span>&mdash;Human faces. Brazil.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The characters in Fig. 1169 are somewhat more elaborate. The eyes
are decorated with lines and the contour of the face is round.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/dp838_pg708c.jpg" width="550" height="161" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1170.</span>&mdash;Human faces. Brazil.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The characters in Fig. 1170 are carved human faces, some of which
would not be recognized as such unless shown in the series.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1171.</span>&mdash;Double-faced head. Brazil.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The face in Fig. 1171 represents the horizontal projection or plan of
a double-faced head. The central H represents
in this case the top of the head, each of the shafts
of the H being neither more nor less than the
double arch of the eyebrows, joined to which the
representation of the nose in a triangular figure
may be recognized. The most noticeable point
is that if this surface be applied in imagination to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page709" id="page709">[709]</a></span>
the cranium of the bifrontal head, of which it seems to be the covering
or skin, the features of the double-faced heads of the Marajo idols are
immediately recognized, including the orifices by which those idols are
hung on cords, which orifices are seen in the dividing line of the two
faces.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 1172 presents the general
form of decoration found upon
vases bearing figures of the face
as above mentioned. It is a funeral
urn, carved and engraved,
from Marajo, reduced to one-fifth.</p>

</div>

<p>Frequently the face is produced in relief, in which a larger portion
of a vessel is taken to produce more lifelike imitation, as in Fig. 1173.
It is the neck of an anthropomorphic vase of Marajo ornamented with
grooves and lines, red on a white ground, reduced to one-half.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 1174 <i>a</i>, real size, is the neck of a Marajo vase, representing a
human head. The nose and chin are very prominent, the eyes horizontal
and slit in the same direction. This head is remarkable for the
relief of the eyebrows which, after reaching the height of the ears, form
these organs, describing above a second curve in the inverse direction
of the curve of the brow, each brow thus forming an S. There are
other heads in which the eyebrows are prolonged to form the relief of
the ears at the outer extremity. In these cases the whole relief represents
a semicircle more or less irregular, while on the contrary this
relief forms the figure S.</p>

<p>Same figure, <i>b</i>, real size, is the neck of an ornithomorphic, anthropocephalous
vase. It has on the face the classic and conventional T to
represent the nose and brows. The eyes are formed by the symbolic
figure equally conventional in the ceramics of the mound-builders of
Marajo, and the ears differ very little from the characters seen in other
figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page710" id="page710">[710]</a></span></p>

<p>Same figure, <i>c</i>, four-fifths real size, is the neck of a Marajo vase representing,
by engraving and painting, all the conventional characters
of the different parts of the human face employed by the mound-builders
of Marajo. This vase preserves perfectly the primitive colors, which
show vermilion lines on a white ground. A double protuberance from
each ear, the design which forms the eyes, and that which surrounds
and outlines the mouth, the nose, and the ears, are characteristic traces
of the decorative art of the human face which few heads present in
such perfection.</p>

<p>Same figure, <i>d</i>, four-fifths real size, is the neck of a Marajo vase more
simple than the preceding one, but with more regular and distinct
features.</p>

</div>

<p>The Brazilian system above illustrated, which reduces the face to
certain main lines and finally to the eyes, in such manner that the eyes
are placed apart and each is put by itself in a symmetric field, has its
parallel in North America. This is the practice of the Bella Coola Indians
and their neighbors at the present day. They divide the surface,
to be ornamented into zones and fields, by means of broad horizontal
and vertical lines, each field containing, according to its position, now
a complete face, now only an indication of it, the especial indication<span class="pagenum"><a name="page711" id="page711">[711]</a></span>
being made by the eye. The eyes themselves are given different shapes,
according to the different animals represented, being now large and
round, now oblong and with pointed angles. These peculiarities, which
have become conventional, are retained when the eye is represented
alone, so that by this method it may still be easy to recognize which
animal&mdash;for example, a raven or a bear, is intended to be portrayed.</p>

<p>The left-hand character in Fig. 1175, from Champollion (<i>g</i>), is the
Egyptian character for a human face. The predominance
of the ears probably has some special
significance.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1175.</span>&mdash;Human heads.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Schoolcraft (<i>u</i>) gives the right-hand character
of the same figure as a man’s head, with ears open to conviction, as
made by the Ojibwa.</p>

<p>Both of these may be compared with the exaggerated ears in Fig. <a href="#page706">1167</a>.</p>


<h4>HAND.</h4>

<p>The impression, real or represented, of a human hand is used in several
regions in the world with symbolic significance.</p>

<p>Among the North American Indians the mark so readily applied is
of frequent occurrence, with an ascertained significance, which, however,
differs in several tribes.</p>

<p>Fig. 1176, taken from Copway (<i>b</i>), represents the hand, and also expresses
“did so.” This signification of “do,” or action,
and hence “power,” is also given to the same character
in the Egyptian and Chinese ideograms.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 56px;">
<img src="images/dp841_pg711b.png" width="56" height="85" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1176.</span>&mdash;Hand.
Ojibwa.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Among several Indian tribes a black hand on a garment
or ornament means “the wearer of this has killed
an enemy.” The decoration appears upon Ojibwa bead belts, and the
Hidatsa and Arikara state that it is an old custom of showing bravery.
The character was noticed at Fort Berthold, and the belt bearing it had
been received from Ojibwa Indians of northern Minnesota. The mark of
a black hand drawn of natural size or less, and sometimes made by the
impress of an actually blackened palm, was also noticed, with the same
significance, on articles among the Hidatsa and Arikara in 1881.</p>

<p>Schoolcraft (<i>x</i>) says of the Dakota on the St. Peters river that a red
hand indicates that the wearer has been wounded by his enemy, and a
black hand that he has slain his enemy.</p>

<p>Irving (<i>b</i>) remarks, in Astoria, of the Arikara warriors: “Some had
the stamp of a red hand across their mouths, a sign that they had
drunk the life-blood of a foe.”</p>

<p>In other parts of the present paper the significance of the mark is
mentioned and may be briefly summarized here.</p>

<p>Among the Sioux a red hand painted on a warrior’s blanket or robe
means that he has been wounded by the enemy, and a black hand that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page712" id="page712">[712]</a></span>
he has been in some way unfortunate. Among the Mandan a yellow
hand on the breast signifies that the wearer had captured prisoners.</p>

<p>Among the Titon Dakota a hand displayed meant that the wearer
had engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle with an enemy. The impress
of a hand, stained or muddy, upon the body or horse was the Winnebago
mark that the wearer had killed a man.</p>

<p>The drawing of linked fingers or joined hands has been before discussed,
p. <a href="#page643">643</a>, and in several petroglyphs illustrated in this paper the
single hand appears. It is a common device on rocks, and doubtless
with varieties of signification, as above mentioned in other forms of
pictograph.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1177.</span>&mdash;Joined hands.
Moki.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It will suffice now to add that the figure of a hand with extended
fingers is very common in the vicinity of ruins in Arizona as a rock
etching, and is also frequently seen daubed on the rocks with colored
pigments or white clay. But Mr. Thomas V. Keam
explains the Arizona drawings of hands on the authority
of the living Moki. In his MS., in describing
Fig. 1177, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The outline of two outstretched hands joined at the wrists
and figure of a hand with extended fingers is very common as a rock etching.</p>

<p>These are vestiges of the test formerly practiced among young men who aspired
for admission to the fraternity of Salyko. The Salyko is a trinity of two women
and a woman from whom the Hopitu obtained the first corn. The first test above
referred to was that of putting their hands in the mud and impressing them upon
the rock. Only those were chosen as novices the imprints of whose hands had dried
on the instant.</p></div>

<p>Le Plongeon (<i>a</i>) tells that the tribes of Yucatan have the custom of
printing the impress of the human hand, dipped in a red-colored liquid,
on the walls of certain sacred edifices.</p>

<p>A. W. Howitt, in manuscript notes on Australian pictographs, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In very many places there are representations of a human hand imprinted or delineated
upon the rocks or in caverns. In the mountains on the western side of the Darling
river, in New South Wales, I have observed such, and the aborigines whom I questioned
upon the subject said that these representations were made in sport. This
reply would, however, be also given were any white man to find and draw their attention
to one of the figures which are made in connection with the initiation ceremonies.
The representations of hands are made in two ways. In one the hand is
smeared with red ocher and water, and impressed upon the rock surface. In the
other the hand, being placed upon the rock, a mouthful of red ocher or pipe-clay and
water is squirted over it. The hand being then removed there remains its representation
surrounded and marked out by the colored wash.</p></div>

<p>Thomas Worsnop (<i>b</i>) says:</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1178.</span>&mdash;Cave painting, Australia.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Winnecke, in 1879, saw several drawings on rocks and in caves, [Fig. 1178],
and describes them as follows:</p>

<p>There are found in several large caves near Mount Skinner and Ledans hill, in
latitude 22° 30′ south and longitude 134° 30′ east. The natives appear to have
selected the smooth surface of granite rocks inside several large caves, which spots
are not subject to the influence of wind or rain. These caves are resorted to by the
natives during excessive rainy seasons, as indicated by their camp preparations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page713" id="page713">[713]</a></span>
it is beyond doubt that these drawings have been performed during these periods of
forced inactivity by some artistically inclined native. Those I am alluding to are
somewhat numerous in these particular localities and present a uniform appearance.</p>

<p><i>a</i>, apparently represents a heart pierced in the center by a spear. The outline of
the object representing the heart has been delineated with red ocher, whilst the spear
has been drawn with a burnt stick or piece of coal. I have only seen this particular
sketch in one instance, where four distinct drawings of the same object exactly below
and equidistant from each other have been made in anything but a crude manner,
the outline having been carefully and very distinctly traced on the rocks, showing
a degree of perfection scarcely to be anticipated from these wild inhabitants. The
breadth of the heart is about 5 inches and its length about 6 inches. The length of
the spear portion is about 3 feet. [The device reminds of St. Valentine’s day.]</p>

<p><i>b</i>, consists of two parallel lines about 6 inches apart, with regular marks between,
and probably represents the native’s notion of a creek with emu tracks traversing
its bed. This drawing has been made with a coal, and is found depicted on smooth
rocks in various localities.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, has been drawn both with coal and red ocher. It is found in many places, and
seems to be a favorite drawing of the natives. I have found it depicted in several
localities in the interior of Australia. It is generally supposed to represent a hand.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> This figure is made by the natives in the following manner: Placing their extended
hand against a smooth rock, after having previously moistened the same, they
fill their mouths with powdered charcoal, which they then blow violently along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page714" id="page714">[714]</a></span>
outline of their extended hand, thus leaving the portions of rock covered perfectly
clean, whilst the space between their fingers and elsewhere around about becomes
covered with the black substance. This drawing is not very common. I found several
specimens near the Sabdover river. I have, however, been informed that it has
been seen in other and distant parts of Australia.</p></div>

<p>Renan (<i>a</i>) says in the chapter on the Nomad Semites:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The real monuments of the period were, as in the case with all people who can not
write, the stones which they reared, the columns erected in memory of some event,
and upon which was often represented a hand, whence the name of <i>iad</i> [finger post].</p></div>

<p>Major Conder (<i>c</i>) writes that in Jerusalem a rough representation of
a hand is marked by the native races on the wall of every house while
building. Some authorities connect it with the five names of God, and
it is generally considered to avert the evil eye. The Moors generally,
and especially the Arabs in Kairwan, apply paintings of red hands
above the doors and on the columns of their houses as talismans to
drive away the envious. Similar hand prints are found in the ruins of
El Baird near Petra. Some of the quaint symbolism connected with
horns is supposed to originate from such hand marks. The same people
make the gesture against the evil eye by extending the five fingers of
the left hand.</p>

<p>H. Clay Trumbull (<i>b</i>) gives the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a noteworthy fact that among the Jews in Tunis, near the old Phenician
settlement of Carthage, the sign of a bleeding hand is still an honored and a sacred
symbol as if in recognition of the covenant-bond of their brotherhood and friendship.
“What struck me most in all the houses,” says a traveler (Chevalier de Hesse-Wartegg)
among these Jews, “was the impression of an open bleeding hand on every
wall of each floor. However white the walls, this repulsive (yet suggestive) sign
was to be seen everywhere.”</p></div>

<p>The following is extracted from Panjab Notes and Queries, Vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>,
No. 1 (October, 1883), p. 2:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the Temple of Balasundarí Deví at Tilokpúr, near Náhan, the priests stamp a
red hand on the left breast of the coat of a pilgrim who visits the temple for the first
time to show that he has, as it were, paid for his footing. If the pilgrim again visits
the temple and can show the stamp he pays only 4 annas as his fee to the priests.</p></div>

<p>Gen. A. Hontum-Schindler, Teheran, Persia, in a letter of December
19, 1888, tells:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All through Persia, principally in villages though, a rough representation of a
hand, or generally the imprint of a right hand, in red, may be seen on the wall or
over the door of a house whilst in building, or on the wall of a mosque, booth, or
other public building. It is probably an ancient custom, although the Persians connect
it with Islam, and they say that the hand represents that of Albas, a brother of
Husain (a grandson of the prophet Mohammed), who was one of the victims at the
massacre of Kerbela in 680, and who had his right hand cut off by el Abrad ibu
Shaibân. In India I have noticed similar marks, hands, or simply red streaks.</p></div>

<p>In Journal of the Proc. Royal Soc. Antiq., Ireland, <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, 3, fifth series,
1890, p. 247, is the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The hand an emblem of good luck in Ireland.&mdash;In Maj. Conder’s “Syrian Stone
Lore,” published for the Palestine Exploration Committee by Bentley &amp; Son (1886),
p. 71, occurs the following passage: “Among other primitive emblems used by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page715" id="page715">[715]</a></span>
Phenicians is the hand occurring on votive steles at Carthage, sometimes in connection
with the sacred fish. This hand is still a charm in Syria, called Kef Miriam,
‘the Virgin Mary’s hand,’ and sovereign against the evil eye. The red hand is
painted on walls, and occurs, for instance, in the Hagia Sophia at Constantinople
and elsewhere. It is common also in Ireland and in India (Siva’s hand) and on early
scepters, always as an emblem of good luck.” What actual foundation is there for the
above statement as regards Ireland? About twenty years ago the first Monday in
January was known in the south of Ireland as “Handsel Monday,” and looked upon
as in some way indicating the prosperity the year succeeding was to bring forth. But
whether, as the name would seem to imply, this had any connection with the hand
as an emblem of good luck I am unaware.&mdash;J. C.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1179.</span>&mdash;Irish cross.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Gen. Forlong (<i>b</i>) makes the following remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The “red hand of Ireland” is known alike to Turanians, Shemites, and Aryans,
and from the Americas to farthest Asia. The hand,
being an organ peculiar to man, is in the East a
sign of Siva, and seems to have been identified
with his emblem even by the Medes. All men have
usually worshiped and plighted their troth or
sworn by manual signs, so the hand naturally
stands as the sign of man himself; but more than
this, Easterns attach a significance to it as an
organ without which the procreating one is useless.
In Germany, says J. Grimm, the hand was
<i>Tyr</i>, or the son of Odin, “the one-handed,” for he
lost one limb by the biting wintry wolf&mdash;that is,
he became powerless to produce.... He
was then the “golden-handed,” fertilizer, whom
ancient Irans denoted by their name Zerdosht, and Irish Kelts placed as a talisman
on their Ulster shield.... The Irish solo-phalik idea is seen in the “crosses”
of Clon-Mac-Noise and Monasterboise, where, as in Fig. 1179, all the fingers are carefully
placed in the center of the circle of fertility. The Vedas constantly speak of
Savatar as “the golden-handed sun,” who lost this limb owing to his efforts when
at sacrifice, and who remained impotent until the deity restored to him a hand of
gold.</p>

<p>Hindus, like the high Asian tribes and the old Mexicans, usually
impress a hand covered with blood or vermilion on the door posts
of their temple&mdash;that is, on the Delpheus or “door of life;” and the
great Islamite, Mahmood, when he captured Constantinople, rode up
to the holy feminine shrine of St. Sophia, and reaching up as high as
he could, there unwittingly imprinted this bloody sign of Great Siva.
We must remember how often the hand appears with other significant
objects on the arms of men and nations, and notably so on Roman
standards.... Fig. 1180.</p>

<p>In the old shrines of America, Leslie says, the “sacred hand was
a favorite subject of art,” and Stevens in his Yucatan says, “The red
hand stared us in the face over all the ruined buildings of the country, ...
not drawn or printed, but stamped by the living hand, the
pressure of the palm upon the stone being quite distinct, the thumb
and fingers being extended as we see in the Irish and Hindu hands.”</p></div>

<h4>FEET AND TRACKS.</h4>

<p>In the two first illustrations of this group the respective figures of
the man and the eagle are in the act of forming tracks on the ground.
Such tracks are shown in the next two figures, but without the context<span class="pagenum"><a name="page716" id="page716">[716]</a></span>
might not be recognized as such. The fifth figure is more distinctly
ideographic, showing the
foot and leg as in the act
of making the impress, and the eagle’s feather to
indicate the kind of track which would have been
made by a running eagle.</p>

ideographic. The arm in his character, given in Fig. 1190,
is lengthened so as nearly to touch the broken leg,
which is shown distorted, instead of indicating
the injury by the mere distortion of the
leg itself. The bird over the head, and connected
by a line with it, probably represents
the teal as a name-totem. Perhaps he was
called Broken-Leg after the injury.</p>

that The-Elk-that-Holloes-Walking, then chief of the
Minneconjous, was then at Spotted-Tail’s camp. His
father was Red-Fish. He was the elder brother of
Lone-Horn. His name is given as A-hag-a-hoo-man-ie,
translated The-Elk’s-Voice-Walking, compounded of he-ha-ka, elk, and
omani, walk; this according to Lavary’s literation. The correct literation
of the Dakota word meaning elk is heqaka; voice, ho; and to walk,
walking, mani. Their compound would be heqaka ho mani, the translation
being the same as above given.</p>

<p>The Mexican pictograph, Fig. 1200, taken from Kingsborough (<i>n</i>), is
illustrative of the sign made by the Arikara and Hidatsa
for “tell” and “conversation.” “Tell me” is:
Place the flat right hand, palm upward, about 15
inches in front of the right side of the face, fingers
pointing to the left and front; then draw the hand
inward toward and against the bottom of the chin. For “conversation,”
talking between two persons, both hands are held before the
breast, pointing forward, palms up, the edges being moved several
times toward one another. Perhaps, however, the picture in fact only
means the common poetical image of “flying words.”</p>

“talk,” and more especially that for “sing,” in which the
extended and separated fingers are passed forward and
slightly downward from the mouth&mdash;“many voices.”
Although late criticisms of the bishop’s work are unfavorable
to its authenticity, yet even if it were prepared
by a Maya, under his supervision, the latter would probably have given
him some genuine native conceptions, and among them gestures would
be likely to occur.</p>

<p>The original, from near Santa Lucia, Guatemala, represents a sepulchral tablet,

<h4>DWELLINGS.</h4>

<p>Irving (<i>c</i>) noticed fifty years ago that each tribe of Indians has a different
mode of shaping and arranging lodges, and especially that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page720" id="page720">[720]</a></span>
Omaha make theirs gay and fanciful with undulating bands of red
and yellow or with dressed and painted buffalo skins.</p>

<p>The left-hand upper characters of Fig. 1203 represents Dakota lodges
as drawn by the Hidatsa. These characters when carelessly or rudely
drawn can only be distinguished from personal marks by their position
and their relation to other characters.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1203.</span>&mdash;Dwellings.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The right-hand upper characters of the same figure signify, among
the Hidatsa, earth lodges. The circles represent the ground plan of
the lodges, while the central markings are
intended to represent the upright poles,
which support the roof on the interior.
Some of these are similar to the Kadiak
drawing for island, Fig. <a href="#page322">439</a>.</p>

<p>The left-hand lower character of the figure
represents buildings erected by civilized
men; the character is generally used by the
Hidatsa to designate government buildings
and traders’ stores.</p>

<p>The remaining character is the Hidatsati, the home of the Hidatsa;
an inclosure having earth lodges within it.</p>

<p>Prof. Cyrus Thomas, in A Study of the Manuscript Troano, Contrib.

<p>The side wall in Fig. 1212 appears to be composed of blocks of some kind placed
one upon another, probably of stone, each bearing the <i>Muluc</i> character. The character
at the top of the wall with a cross in it, somewhat resembling that in the symbol<span class="pagenum"><a name="page722" id="page722">[722]</a></span>

This probably marks the end of the beam which
was placed on the wall to support the roof.
The curved line running from this to the top
portion probably represents the rafter; the
slender thread-like lines (yellow in the original)
the straw or grass with which the roof was
thatched.</p>

frightened. The sun is a dark globe and the stars appear. The-Swan’s

<p>The left-hand design on the lower line of Pl.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page613">XLIX</a></span> is reproduced from Kingsborough. “In
this year there was a great eclipse of the sun.”</p>

<p>Humboldt infers from this painting that the
Mexicans were informed of the real cause of the
eclipses; which would not be at all surprising
considering the many other curious things with
which they were acquainted, the knowledge of which they must have
derived from the West. It is proper to observe that on the 127th page
of the Vatican MS., where a representation of the same eclipse occurs,
the disk of the moon does not appear to be projecting over that of the
sun. The Vatican MS. appears to have been copied from a Mexican
painting similar to but not the same as that which Pedro de los Rios
copied, whose notes and interpretations the Italian interpreter had
before his eyes and strictly followed.</p>

winter.”</p>

<p>This and the three following figures evidently
refer to the fall of a single large meteor in the land
of the Dakotas some time in the winter of 1821-’22.
The fact can not be verified by scientific records.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page723" id="page723">[723]</a></span>

<h4>THE CROSS.</h4>

<p>Referring to the numerous forms of cross delineated in the work of
Mr. W. H. Holmes (<i>d</i>), it is to be noted that most of them are equilateral
or the Greek pattern, and that similar ornaments or instruments
now used by the Dakotas are always worn so that the cross upon them
stands as if resting on one foot only and not on two, as is the mode in
which St. Andrew’s cross is drawn.</p>

<p>The “Greek” cross represents to the Dakota the four winds, which
issue from the four caverns in which the souls of men existed before
their incarnation in the human body. All “medicine-men,” i. e., conjurers
and magicians, recollect their previous dreamy life in those
places and the instructions then received from the gods, demons, and
sages. They recollect and describe their preexistent life, but only
dream and speculate as to the future life beyond the grave.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 222px;">
<img src="images/dp855_pg725a.png" width="222" height="233" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1225.</span>&mdash;Cross. Dakota.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The top of the cross is the cold all-conquering giant, the North-wind,
most powerful of all. It is worn on the body nearest the head, the seat
of intelligence and conquering devices. The left arm covers the heart;
it is the East-wind, coming from the seat of life and love. The foot is
the melting burning South-wind, indicating, as it is worn, the seat of
fiery passion. The right arm is the gentle West-wind, blowing from
the spirit land, covering the lungs, from which the breath at last goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page725" id="page725">[725]</a></span>
out, gently, but into unknown night. The center of the cross is the
earth and man, moved by the
conflicting influences of the
gods and winds. This cross is
often illustrated as in Fig. 1225.
It is sometimes drawn and depicted
in beadwork and also on
copper, as in Fig. 1226, extracted
from the Second Ann.
Rep. Bur. Ethn., Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">LII</span>, Fig. 4, where it appears cut out of a copper
plate found in an Ohio mound.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1226.</span>&mdash;Cross. Ohio mound.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But among some of the Indian tribes the true Latin cross is found,
viz, upright with three members of equal length, and the fourth, the
foot, much longer. The use of this symbol antedates the discovery of
America, and is carried far back in tradition and myth. When a missionary
first asked a Dakota the name of this figure, which he drew for
him in the sand, wishing to use the information in his translation of
Bible and Creed, the Dakota promptly replied Sus-be-ca, and retraced
the figure saying “That is a Sus-be-ca.” It was therefore promptly
transferred to Scripture and Creed where it still reads “He was nailed
to the Susbeca,” etc. “God forbid that I should glory save in the
Susbeca of our Lord Jesus Christ.” To the good missionary this was
plain and satisfactory; for the Dakota had demonstrated by tracing it
in the sand that Susbeca was the name of the figure called in English,
“cross.” The foregoing statement is made on the excellent authority
of Rev. S. D. Hinman.</p>

<p>But when the Dakota read his new Bible or Creed, he must have
been puzzled or confused to find, “He was nailed to a mosquito-hawk,”
or, “God forbid that I should glory save in the mosquito-hawk of our
Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 153px;">
<img src="images/dp855_pg725c.png" width="153" height="208" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1227.</span>&mdash;Dragon
fly.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The same disposition of straight lines which is called the Latin cross
was and is used by the Dakota to picture or signify both in pictograph
and gesture sign, the mosquito-hawk, more generally called
dragon fly. The Susbeca or mosquito-hawk is a supernatural
being. He is gifted with speech. He warns men
of danger. He approaches the ear of the man moving
carelessly or unconcernedly through the deep grass of the
meadow or marsh&mdash;approaches his ear silently and at right
angles, as shown in Fig. 1227<i>a</i>, and says to him, now
alarmed, “Tci”-“tci”-“tci!”&mdash;which is an interjection<span class="pagenum"><a name="page726" id="page726">[726]</a></span>
equivalent to “Look out!” “You are surely going to destruction!”
“Look out!” “Tci”-“tci”-“tci!”</p>

<p>Now the mosquito-hawk is easily knocked down and caught and has
a temptingly small neck. But woe to the man or woman or child who
with the cruelty commonly practiced on all living things by Indians of all
ages and states, dares to wring off his head. Whoever shall do this
before the winter comes shall be beheaded by the detested Ojibwa. It
is true, for long ago a reckless young warrior feeling annoyed or
insulted by the infernal “Tci”-“tci”-“tci!” so unceremoniously uttered
in explosive breaths near his ear, tried it, and his headless trunk was
found ere he escaped from the swamp.</p>

<p>The cross has its proper significance in this use not only in representing
quite faithfully the shape of the insect but also the angle of
his approach. It is variously drawn, but usually as in Fig. 1227, <i>a</i>, or
<i>b</i>, and in painting or embroidery, <i>c</i>, and sometimes <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>One reason for the adoption of the dragon fly as a mysterious and
supernatural being, is on account of its sudden appearance in large
numbers. When in the still of the evening, before the shades of darkness
come, there is heard from the meadow a hum as of the sound of
crickets or frogs, but indistinct and prolonged; on the morrow the
Susbeca will be hovering over it; it is the sound of their coming, but
whence no man kens. See also Fig. <a href="#page705">1165</a> and remarks.</p>

<p>Among the Ojibwa of northern Minnesota the cross is one of the
sacred symbols of the society of the Midē or shamans, and has
special reference to the fourth degree. A neophyte who has been
advanced to the third initiation or degree, is instructed in ritualistic
chants purporting to relate the struggle between Mi'nabō'zho, the
mediator between the Ojibwa and Ki'tshi Ma'nidō, and the malevolent
Bear spirit, which contest occurred when Mi'nabō'zho entered the
fourth degree structure at the time when the first Indian was inducted
therein for initiation.</p>

<p>The structure as erected at this day is built in the form of an oblong
square having openings or doors at the four cardinal points. At these
openings Mi'nabō'zho appeared and shot into the inclosure charmed
arrows, to expel the horde of demons occupying the sacred place, and the
Bear spirit was the last to yield to his superior powers. The openings
being opposite to one another, north and south and east and west, suggested
to Mi'nabō'zho the cross, which is now erected whenever a third
degree Midē receives this last and highest honor.</p>

<p>The cross is made of saplings, the upright pole reaching the height
of 4 to 6 feet, the transverse arms being somewhat shorter, each being
of the same length as that part of the pole between the arms and the
top. The upper parts are painted white, or besmeared with white clay,
over which are spread small spots of red, the latter suggesting the
sacred shell or mēgis, the symbol of the order. The lower arm or pole
is squared, the surface toward the east being painted white, to denote<span class="pagenum"><a name="page727" id="page727">[727]</a></span>
the source of light and warmth. The face on the south is green, denoting
the source of the thunder bird who brings the rains and causes the
appearance of vegetation; the surface toward the west is covered with
vermilion and relates to the land of the setting sun, the abode of the
dead. The north is painted black, as that faces the direction from which
come affliction, cold, and hunger.</p>

<p>Illustrations and additional details on this topic are presented in the
paper of Dr. Hoffman (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>In the chart presented in that paper, Pl. B, a midē' structure is also

<p>Groups of small crosses incised upon ivory bow drills
and representing flocks of birds, occur on Eskimo specimens,
Nos. 45020 and 44211, in the collection of the U. S.
National Museum. They are reproduced in Fig. 1228.
In Figs. 429 and <a href="#page697">1129</a>, representing petroglyphs at Oakley
Springs, Arizona, are crosses which are mentioned by
Mr. G. K. Gilbert as signifying stars. The simple cross
appears to be the simplest type of character to represent
stellar forms. See Figs. 1219, 1220, 1221 and 1223.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#page068">28</a>, supra, represents a cross copied from the Najowe Valley group
of colored pictographs, 40 miles west of Santa Barbara, California.
The cross measures 10 inches in length, the interior portion being
painted black, while the outside or border is of a dark red tint. This
drawing, as well as numerous others in close connection, is painted on
the walls of a shallow cave or rock-shelter in the limestone formation.</p>

<p>Fourteen miles west of Santa Barbara, on the summit of the Santa
Ynez mountains, are caverns having a large opening, facing the northwest
and north, in which crosses occur of the types given in Fig. <a href="#page071">33</a>,
supra.</p>

<p>The interior portion of the cross is of a dull, earthy red, while the
outside line is of a faded black tint.
The cross measures nearly a foot in
extent.</p>

</div>

<p>At Tulare Indian agency, Tulare
valley, California, is an immense
bowlder of granite which has become
broken in such a manner that one of
the lower quarters has moved away
from the larger mass sufficiently to
leave a passageway 6 feet wide and
nearly 10 feet high. The interior walls are well covered with large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page728" id="page728">[728]</a></span>
painted figures, while upon the ceiling are numerous forms of animals,
birds, and insects. Among this latter group is a white cross
measuring about 18 inches in length, Fig. 1229, presenting a unique
appearance, for the reason
that white coloring matter
applied to petroglyphs is,
with this single exception,
entirely absent in that
region.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting
series of rock sculpturings
in groups is that in
Owens valley, south of Benton,
California. Among
these various forms of
crosses occur, and circles
containing crosses of various
simple and complex types, as shown in Pls. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page058">I</a></span> to <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page059">XI</a></span> and in Mojave
desert, California, illustrated in Fig. <a href="#page061">19</a>, but the examples of most interest
in the present connection are the two shown herewith in Fig.
1230, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The larger one, <i>a</i>, occurs upon a large bowlder of trachyte, blackened
by exposure, located 16 miles south of Benton, at a locality known as
the Chalk Grade. The circle is a depression about 1 inch in depth,
the cross being in high relief within. Another smaller cross, <i>b</i>, found
3 miles north of the one above-mentioned, is almost identical, each of
the arms of the cross, however, extending to the rim of the circle.</p>

<p>In this locality occurs also the form of the cross <i>c</i>, in the same figure,
and some examples having more than two cross arms. Other simple
forms clearly represent the human form, but by erosion the arms and
body have become partially obliterated so as to lose all trace of resemblance
to humanity.</p>

<p>In the same figure, <i>d</i>, from a rock in the neighborhood, exhibits the
outline of the human form, while in <i>e</i> parts of the extremities have
been removed by erosion so that the resemblance is less striking; in
<i>f</i> a simple cross occurs, which may also have been intended to represent
the same, but through disintegration the extremities have been so
greatly changed or erased that their original forms can not be determined.</p>

<p>Rev. John McLean (<i>a</i>) says: “On the sacred pole of the sun lodge of
the Blood Indians two bundles of small brushwood taken from the birch
tree were placed in the form of a cross. This was an ancient symbol
evidently referring to the four winds.”</p>

<p>Concerning Fig. 1232, Keam, in his MS., says:</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1232.</span>&mdash;Crosses. Moki.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Maltese cross is the emblem of a virgin; still so recognized by the Moki. It
is a conventional development of a more common emblem of maidenhood, the form
in which the maidens wear their hair arranged as a disk of 3 or 4 inches in diameter
upon each side of the head. This discoidal arrangement of their hair is typical of
the emblem of fructification worn by the virgin in the Muingwa festival, as exhibited
in the head-dress illustration <i>a</i>. Sometimes the hair, instead of being worn in
the complete discoid form, is dressed from two curving twigs and presents the form
of two semicircles upon each side of the head. The partition of these is sometimes
horizontal and sometimes vertical. A combination of both of these styles, <i>b</i>, presents
the form from which the Maltese cross was conventionalized. The brim decorations
are of ornamental locks of hair which a maiden trains to grow upon the
sides of the forehead.</p></div>

</div>

<p>The ceremonial employment of the cross by
the Pueblo is detailed in Mr. Stevenson’s paper
entitled Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and
Mythical Sand-painting of the Navajo Indians,
in the Eighth Ann. Rept. Bur. Ethn.,
p. 266, where it denotes the scalp-lock.</p>

<p>In the present paper the figure of the cross among the North American
Indians is presented under other headings with many differing
significations. Among other instances it appears on p. <a href="#page383">383</a> as the tribal
sign for Cheyenne; on p. <a href="#page582">582</a> as Dakota lodges; on p. <a href="#page613">613</a> as the character
for trade or exchange; on p. <a href="#page227">227</a> as the conventional sign for
prisoner; on p. <a href="#page438">438</a> for personal exploits; while elsewhere it is used in
simple numeration.</p>


<div class="parallel">

<p>But, although this device is used with a great variety of meanings,
when it is employed ceremonially or in elaborate pictographs by the
Indians both of North and South America, it represents the four winds.
The view long ago suggested that such was the significance
of the many Mexican crosses, is sustained by Prof.
Cyrus Thomas, in his Notes on Maya and Mexican MSS.,
Second Ann. Rep. Bur. Ethn., p. 61, where strong confirmatory
evidence is produced by the arms of the crosses
having the appearance of conventionalized wings, similar
to some representations of the thunder-bird by more
northern tribes. Yet the same author, in his paper on the
Study of the MS. Troano, Contrib. N. A. Ethn., <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>, 144, gives Fig.
1233 as the symbol for wood, thus further showing the manifold concepts
attached to the general form.</p>

<p>Bandelier (<i>a</i>) thinks that the crosses which were frequently used before
the conquest by the aborigines of Mexico and Central America
were merely ornaments and were not objects of worship, while the so-called
crucifixes, like that on the “Palenque tablet,” were only the
symbol of the “new fire” or close of a period of fifty-two years. He
believes them to be merely representations of “fire-drills,” more or less
ornamented.</p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Holmes (<i>e</i>) shows by a series representing steps in the
simplification of animal characters that
in Chiriqui a symmetrical cross was developed
from the design of an alligator.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1235.</span>&mdash;Cross. Guatemala.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Dr. S. Habel (<i>f</i>), describing Fig. 1235, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On it is a person in a reclining position, with a single band tied around his forehead,
forming a knot with two pendent tassels. From his temple rises an ornament resembling
the wing of a bird. The emaciated face, as well as the recumbent position of
the body, indicates a state of sickness. The hair is interwoven behind with many
ribbons forming loops, which are bound together by a clasp, and then spread out in
the shape of a fan. The ear is ornamented with a circular disk, to the center of
which are attached a plume and a twisted ornament similar to a queue. On the
breast is a kind of brooch, which is hollow like a shell, and in which are imbedded
seven pearls. Around the waist are three rows of a twisted fabric, which is knotted
in front in a bow, the ends descending between the thighs. Another band, of a different
texture, stretches out horizontally from the region of the above-mentioned
knot. Attached to this girdle is another fabric, of a scaly texture, which surrounds
the thighs. The right leg, below the knee, is encircled with a ribbon and a rosette.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page731" id="page731">[731]</a></span>
This would seem to be the undress substitute for the band and pendant. In front
of the recumbent person stands the representation of a skeleton, quite well executed.
Other points noticeable about this skeleton are the hair on the head and the fact
that its hands are fleshy and the fingers and toes have nails. Like all representations
by these sculptures, the skeleton is also embellished with ornaments.</p>

<p>From the back of the head emanate two objects similar to horns, which, if they
were not differently ribbed, might represent flames. The ear is ornamented with a
circular disk, with a pendant from its center. A double-ruffled collar surrounds the
neck and a serpent encircles the loins. Both the shoulders and arms are enveloped
in flames. From the mouth emanates a bent staff, touching the first of a row of ten
circles. Beneath the second and third circles are five bars, three of which are horizontal.
The lowest one is the longest, while the two upper ones are shorter and of
different lengths. On the uppermost of these bars rest two others, crossing each
other obliquely, and touching with their upper ends two of the aforesaid circles.
From the last of these circles descend serpentine lines, which touch the ground behind
the recumbent person.</p></div>

<p>W. F. Wakeman (<i>a</i>) makes the following remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A cross was used by the people of Erin as a symbol of some significance at a period
long antecedent to the mission of St. Patrick or the introduction of Christianity
to this island. It is found, not unfrequently, amongst the scribings picked or carved
upon rock surfaces and associated with a class of archaic designs, to the meaning
of which we possess no key. * * * It may be seen on prehistoric monuments in
America, on objects of pottery found by Dr. Schliemann at Hissarlik and at Mycenæ,
and, in more than one form, on pagan Roman altars still preserved in Germany and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page732" id="page732">[732]</a></span>
Britain. With the Chinese it was for untold ages a symbol of the earth. The Rev.
Samuel Beal, <span class="smcap lowercase">B. A.</span>, rector of Flastone, North Tyrone, professor of Chinese in University
College, London, writes: “Now, the earliest symbol of the earth was a plain
cross, denoting the four cardinal points; hence we have the word chaturanta, i. e.,
the four sides, both in Pâli and Sanscrit, for the earth; and on the Nestorian tablet,
found at Siganfu some years ago, the mode of saying “God created the earth” is
simply this: “God created the +.””</p></div>

<p>A writer in the Edinburgh Review in an article entitled “The Pre-Christian
Cross,” January, 1870, p. 254, remarks: “The Buddhists and
Brahmins who together constitute nearly half the population of the
world, tell us that the decussated figure of the cross, whether in a
simple or complex form, symbolizes the traditional happy abode of
their primeval ancestors.”</p>

<p>Rudolf Cronau (<i>c</i>), describing Fig. 1237, says that in the Berlin
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeughause</span> are swords of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, bearing
the marks shown in <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
and <i>d</i>, while those having the
marks <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> are from swords
in the Historical Museum at
Dresden.</p>

</div>

<p>The remarkable resemblance
of some of these characters
to forms on petroglyphs in the three Americas, presented in this
paper, will at once be noticed.</p>

<p>D’Alviella (<i>c</i>), remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of the most frequent forms of the cross is called the gamma cross, because its
four arms are bent at a right angle so as to form a figure like that of four Greek
gammas turned in the same direction and joined at the base. We meet it among
all the peoples of the Old World, from Japan to Iceland, and it is found in the two
Americas. There is nothing to prevent us from supposing that in the instance it
was spontaneously conceived everywhere, like the equilateral crosses, circles, triangles,
chevrons, and other geometrical ornaments so frequent in primitive decoration.
But we see it, at least among the peoples of the Old Continent, invariably passing for
talisman, appearing in the funeral scenes or on the tombstones of Greece, Scandinavia,
Numidia, and Thibet, and adorning the breasts of divine personages&mdash;of Apollo
and Buddha&mdash;without forgetting certain representations of the Good Shepherd
in the Catacombs.</p></div>

<p>It is, however, impossible within the present limits, to attempt even
a summary of the vast amount of literature on this topic. Perhaps one
symbolic use of the form which is not commonly known is of sufficient
interest to be noted. Travelers say that crosses are exhibited in the
curtains of the monasteries of the Thibetan Buddhists, to mean peace
and quietness. With the same conception the loopholes of the Japanese
forts were in time of peace covered with curtains embroidered with
crosses, which when war broke out were removed.</p>

<p>It is also impossible to refrain from quoting the following, translated
with condensation, from de Mortillet (<i>a</i>). The illustration referred to
is reproduced in the present paper by Fig. 1238, the right-hand figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="page733" id="page733">[733]</a></span>
being from the vase, and that on the left the recognized monogram of
Christ:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 265px;">
<img src="images/dp863_pg733.jpg" width="265" height="120" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1238.</span>&mdash;Cross. Golasecca.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There can no longer be any doubt as to the use of
the cross as a religious symbol long before the advent
of Christianity. The worship of the cross, extensive
throughout Gaul before the conquest, already existed
during the bronze age, more than a thousand years
before Christ.</p>

<p>It is especially in the sepulchres of Golasecca that
this worship is revealed in the most complete manner, and there, strange to say, has
been found a vessel bearing the ancient monogram of Christ, designed perhaps 1,000
years before the coming of Jesus Christ. Is the isolated presence of this monogram
of Christ in the midst of numerous crosses, an entirely accidental coincidence?</p>

<p>Another curious fact, very interesting to prove, is that this great development of
the worship of the cross before the coming of Christ seems to coincide with the
absence of idols and indeed of any representation of living objects. Whenever such
objects appear, it may be said that the crosses become more rare and finally disappear
altogether. The cross has then been, in remote antiquity, long before Christ,
the sacred emblem of a religious sect which repudiated idolatry.</p></div>

<p>The author, with considerable naiveté, has evidently determined that
the form of the cross was significant of a high state of religious culture,
and that its being succeeded by effigies, which he calls idols, showed a
lapse into idolatry. The fact is simply that, next after one straight
line, the combination of two straight lines forming a cross is the easiest
figure to draw, and its use before art could attain to the drawing of
animal forms, or their representation in plastic material, is merely an
evidence of crudeness or imperfection in designing. It is worthy of remark
that Dr. Schliemann, in his “Troja,” page 107, presents as his
Fig. 38 a much more distinct cross than that given by M. de Mortillet,
with the simple remark that it is “a geometrical ornamentation.”</p>

<p>Probably no cause has more frequently produced archeologic and
ethnologic blunders than the determination of Christian explorers and
missionaries to find monograms of Christ in every monument or inscription
where the cross figure appears. The early missionaries to America
were obliged to explain the presence of this figure there by a miraculous
visit of an apostle, St. Thomas being their favorite. Other generations
of the same good people were worried in the same manner by the
cross pattée or Thor hammer of the Scandinavians, and by the conventionalized
clover leaf of the Druids. This figure often has been a symbol
and as often an emblem or a mere sign, but it is so common in
every variety of application that actual evidence is necessary to show
in any special case what is its real significance.</p>

<p>There has been discovered in Sumner county, Tennessee, near the stone graves and
mounds of Castalian springs, a valuable pictograph, the ancient engraved stone
which we have taken the liberty to entitle a Group of Tennessee Mound Builders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page734" id="page734">[734]</a></span></p>

<p>This engraved stone, the property of the Tennessee Historical Society, is a flat,
irregular slab of hard limestone, about 19 inches long and 15 inches wide. It bears
every evidence of very great age. * * * The stone was found on Rocky creek, in
Sumner county, and was presented, with other relics, to the Tennessee Historical
Society about twelve years ago. * * *</p>

<p>It is evidently an ideograph of significance, graven with a steady and skillful hand,
for a specific purpose, and probably records or commemorates some important treaty
or public or tribal event. * * * Indian chiefs fully equipped with the insignia
of office, are arrayed in fine apparel. Two leading characters are vigorously shaking
hands in a confirmatory way. The banner or shield, ornamented with the double
serpent emblem and other symbols, is, doubtless, an important feature of the occasion.
Among the historic Indians, no treaty was made without the presence or presentation
of the belt of wampum. This, the well-dressed female of the group appears
to grasp in her hand, perhaps as a pledge of the contract. The dressing of the
hair, the remarkable scalloped skirts, the implements used, the waistbands, the
wristlets, the garters, the Indian leggings and moccasins, the necklace and breastplates,
the two banners, the serpent emblem, the tattoo stripes, the ancient pipe,
all invest this pictograph with unusual interest. * * * The double serpent emblem
or ornament upon the banner may have been the badge or totem of the tribe,
clan, or family that occupied the extensive earthworks at Castalian springs in
Sumner county, near where the stone was found. The serpent was a favorite emblem
or totem of the Stone Grave race of Tennessee, and is one of the common devices
engraved on the shell gorgets taken from the ancient cemeteries. * * * The
circles or sun symbol ornaments on the banners and dresses are the figures most
frequently graven on the shell gorgets found near Nashville.</p></div>

<p>The following summary of the translation, kindly furnished by Mr.
Pom K. Soh of an article, “Pictures of Dokatu or so-called bronze
bell,” by Mr. K. Wakabayashi (<i>a</i>), in the Bulletin of the Tōkyō Anthropological
Society, refers to Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">LII</span>. The author saw the bell
described at the town of Takoka, Japan, in August, 1891. The “pictures”
on it were fourteen in number, cast in the metal of the bell,
each one occupying a separate compartment and running around the
bell in several bands. The author took rubbings of the pictures, lithographs
of which are published as illustrations of his article, and from
these the eight pictures now presented in actual size are selected, the
remainder being of the same general character, and some of them nearly
identical with those selected. The information obtained is that the
bell, which is iron and not bronze, was procured before, and perhaps long
before, the present century from Jisei, in the village of Sasakura in the
state of Yetsin, and had been excavated from a mountain at Samki.
Copies of the markings upon it were taken in 1817 to a high authority
at Yedo, now Tōkyō. It is believed that the markings illustrate or
are related to a national story, “Kanden Ko Hitsu,” written by Ban
Kokei. A few similar bells or fragments of them, some being bronze,
have been found in various parts of the Japanese empire. One, which
is bronze, height about 3&frac12; feet, and diameter somewhat more than 1
foot, was dug up in Hanina in the year A. D. 821.</p>

Swan while on a visit to the Prince of Wales archipelago,

feet attached to the hind legs. These mythical animals
were placed upon either side of a corpse which
was lying in state, awaiting burial.</p>

<p>The Egyptians represented the evil Typhon by the
hippopotamus, the most fierce and savage of their animals; the hawk
was the symbol for power, and the serpent that for life. Plutarch, in
Isis and Osiris, 50, says that in Hermopolis these symbols were united,
a hawk fighting with a serpent being placed on the hippopotamus, thus
accentuating the idea of the destroyer. The Greeks sometimes substituted
the eagle for the hawk, and pictured it killing a hare, the most
prolific of quadrupeds, or fighting a serpent, the same attribute of destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="page738" id="page738">[738]</a></span>
being portrayed. But the eagle when alone meant simply
power, as did the hawk in Egypt. The Scandinavians posited the
eagle on the head of their god Thor and the bull on his breast to express
a similar union of attributes.</p>

<h3>SECTION 4.<br />

<span class="subhead">ARTISTIC SKILL AND METHODS.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Andree (<i>d</i>), in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Zeichnen bei den Naturvölkern</span>, makes the
following remarks, translated with condensation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The great ability of the Eskimo and their southern neighbors, the natives of northwest
America (Koliushes, Thlinkits, etc.), in representative art is well known and
needs no further insisting. Among all primitive peoples they have made the greatest
advances in the conventionalization of figures, which indicates long practice in painting.
The totem figures, carved both in stone and in wood and tattooed on the body,
show severe conventionalization and have perfect heraldic value. Ismailof, one of
the earliest Russian explorers that came in contact with the Koliushes, relates that
European paintings and drawings did not strike them with the least awe. When a
chief was shown portraits of the Russian imperial family he manifested no astonishment.
That chief was accompanied by his painter, who examined everything
very closely, in order to paint it afterward. He was able in particular “to paint
all manner of objects on wooden tablets and other material (leather),” using blue
iron earth, iron ocher, colored clays, and other mineral colors. Among these peoples,
too, painting is employed as a substitute for writing, in order to record memorable
things.</p>

<p>Far below the artistic achievements of the Eskimo and of the natives of the
American northwest (Haida, Thlinkit, etc.) are those of the redskins east of the Rocky
mountains. They are, however, very productive in figure drawing; nay, that art
has advanced to a kind of picture writing, which, it is true, is not distinguished by
artistic finish. That “fling” which, depending on good observation of nature, appears
in the drawings of Australians, Bushmen, etc., and the good characterization of
the figures, are lacking among the Indians; and though, as is frequently the case,
their animals are better represented than the men, yet they can not compare with
the animal figures of the Eskimo or Bushmen. Dr. Capitan, who had drawings
made by the Omahas shown in 1883 in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin d’acclimatation</span> of Paris, says concerning
them: “It is singular to note that by the side of very rudimentary representations
of human figures the pictures of horses are drawn with a certain degree
of correctness. If the Indians take pains in anything it is in the painting of their
buffalo skins, which are often worn as mantles. On red-brown ground are seen
black figures, especially of animals; on others, on white ground, the heroic deeds
and life events of distinguished Indians, represented in black or in other colors.
You see the wounded enemies, the loss of blood, the killed and the captives, stolen
horses, all executed in the peculiar manner of an art of painting still in the stage of
infancy, with earth colors black, red, green, and yellow. Almost all the Missouri
tribes practice painting on buffalo skins; the most skillful are the Pawnees, Mandans,
Minitaris, and Crows. Among the Mandans, Wied met individuals who possessed
“a very decided talent” for drawing.”</p></div>

<p>The same author, in the same connection, reasserts the old statement
that there is an established difference in artistic capacity between the
so-called mound-builders and the present Indians, so great that it
either shows a genetic difference between them or that the Indians had
degenerated in that respect. This statement is denied by the Bureau<span class="pagenum"><a name="page739" id="page739">[739]</a></span>
of Ethnology, but the point to be now considered is whether it is true
that the historic North American Indians are as low in artistic skill
as is alleged.</p>

<p>The French traveler Crevaux, as quoted by Marcano (<i>g</i>), says that
he had the happy idea of giving pencils to the Indians, in order to see
whether they were capable of producing the same drawings. The
young Yumi rapidly drew for him sketches of man, dog, tiger; in brief,
of all the animals of the country. Another Indian reproduced all sorts
of arabesques, which he was wont to paint with genipa. Crevaux saw
that these savages, who are accused of being absolutely ignorant of the
fine arts, all drew with extraordinary facility.</p>

<p>The same idea, i. e., of testing the artistic ability of Indians in several
tribes, occurred to the present writer and to many other travelers,
who generally have been surprised at the skill in free-hand drawing
and painting exhibited. It would seem that the Indians had about the
same faults and decidedly more talent than the average uninstructed
persons of European descent who make similar attempts. An instance
of special skill in portrait painting is given by Lossing (<i>a</i>), where a
northern tribe in 1812 made a bark picture of Joseph Barron, a fugitive,
to obtain his identification by sending copies of it to various tribes.
The portrait given as an illustration in the work cited is very distinct
and lifelike. This, however, was a special task prompted by foreign
influence. While the Indians had no more knowledge of perspective
than the Japanese, they were unable or indisposed to attempt the accurate
imitation of separate natural objects in which the Japanese
excel. Before European instruction or example they probably never
produced a true picture. Some illustrations in the present work, which
show a continuous series of men, animals, and other objects, are no more
pictures than are the consecutive words of a printed sentence, both
forms, indeed, being alike in the fact that their significance is expressed
by the relation between the separate parts. The illustration
which at a first glance seems to be most distinctively picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="page740" id="page740">[740]</a></span>
is Fig. <a href="#page473">659</a>, but it will be noticed that the personages are repeated, the
scene changed, and the time proceeds, so that there is no view of specified
objects at any one time and place.</p>

<p>Fig. 1254 shows two drawings from Kejimkoojik, N. S., reduced to
one-fourth, each supposed to represent a moose, though possibly one
of them is a caribou, and the mode of execution vividly suggests some
of the examples of prehistoric art found in Europe and familiar by
repeatedly published illustrations.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 1255 is the etching of a hand from the Kejimkoojik rocks, reduced
one-half. Its peculiarity consists
in the details by which the lines
of the palm and markings on the balls
of the thumb and fingers are shown.
If this is the real object of the design
it shows close observation, though it
is not suggested that any connection
with the pseudo-science of palmistry
is to be inferred.</p>

<p>In connection with this drawing the
following translated remarks in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Verhandl.
Berlin. Gesellsch. für Anthrop.</span>
(<i>d</i>), may be noted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The frequency with which partial representations
of the eye are met with appeared to
me so striking that I requested Mr. Jacobson to ask the Bella Coola Indians whether
they had any special idea in employing the eye so frequently. To my great surprise
the person addressed pointed to the palmar surface of his finger tips and to the fine
lineaments which the skin there presents; in his opinion a rounded or longitudinal
field, such as appears between the converging or parallel lines, also means an eye,
and the reason of this is that originally each part of the body terminated in an organ
of sense, particularly an eye, and was only afterward made to retrovert into such
rudimentary conditions.</p></div>

</div>

<p>The lower character in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">LIII</span> is copied from Rudolph Cronau (<i>c</i>)
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte der Solinger Klingenindustrie</span>, where it is presented as an
illustration of the knights of the thirteenth century, after a sketch in
a MS. of the year 1220, in the library of the University of Leipsig.</p>

<p>The upper character in the same plate is a copy of a drawing made
in 1884 by an Apache Indian at Anadarko, although the insignia of the
riders are more like those used by the Cheyenne than those of the
Apache. A striking similarity will be noticed in the motive of the two
sketches of the mounted warriors and their steeds as well as in their
decorations, from which in Europe the devices called heraldic were
differentiated. Doubtless still better examples could be obtained to
compare the degree of artistic skill attained by the several draftsmen,
but these are used as genuine, convenient, and typical. See also the
Mexican representation of horses and riders under the heading of
meteors, Fig. <a href="#page723">1224</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page741" id="page741">[741]</a></span></p>

<p>These horses are far less skillfully portrayed than they are by the
Plains tribes, which may be explained by the fact that the Mexicans
had not yet become familiar with the animal.</p>

<p>A story told by Catlin to the general effect that the Siouan stock of
Indians did not understand the drawing of human faces in profile has
been repeated in various forms. The last is by Popoff (<i>a</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Catlin was drawing the profile of a chief named Matochiga, the Indians
around him seemed greatly moved, and asked why he did not draw the other half of
the chief’s face. “Matochiga was never ashamed to look a white man square in the
face.” Matochiga had not till then seemed offended at the matter, but one of the Indians
said to him sportively, “The Yankee knows that you are only half a man,
and he has only drawn half of your face because the other half is not worth anything.”</p></div>

<p>Another variant of the story is that Catlin was accused of practicing
magic, by which the half of the subject’s head should get into his power,
and he was forced to stop his painting and flee for his life. The explorer
and painter who tells the story is not considered to be altogether
free from exaggeration, and he may have invented the tale to amuse
his auditors in his lectures and afterwards his readers, or he may have
been the victim of a practical joke by the Indians, who are fond of such
banter, and the well-known superstitions about sorcerers gaining possession
of anything attached to the person would have rendered their
anger plausible. But certain it is that the people referred to, before
and after and at the time of the visit of Catlin to them, were in the
habit of drawing the human face in profile, and, indeed, much more
frequently than the full or front face. This is abundantly proved by
many pictures in existence at that time and place which have been seen
by this writer, and a considerable number of them are copied in the
present work. Thus much for one of the oft-cited fictions on which the
allegation of the Indian’s stupidity in drawing has been founded.</p>

<p>Another false statement is copied over and over again by authors, to
the effect that from a similar superstition the Indians are afraid to, and
therefore do not, make delineations of the whole human figure. The
present work shows their drawing of front, side, and rear views of the
whole human figure, presenting as each view may allow, all the limbs
and features. This, however, is rare, not from the fear charged, but
because the artists directed their attention, not to iconography, but to
ideography, seizing some special feature or characteristic for prominence
and disregarding or intentionally omitting all that was unnecessary
to their purpose.</p>

<p>On the other hand the Indians have sometimes been unduly praised
for acumen in observation and for skill in their iconography. For instance,
in the lectures of Mr. Edward Muybridge, explaining the highly
interesting photographs of consecutive movements of animals from
which he formulates the novel science of zoöpraxography, the lecturer
attributes to the Indians a scientific and artistic method of drawing
horses in motion which has excelled in that respect all the most famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page742" id="page742">[742]</a></span>
painters and sculptors. But Mr. Muybridge bases his statement upon
a small number of Indian drawings, apparently seen by him in Europe,
the characteristics of which do not appear in the many drawings of
horses in the possession of the present writer, a considerable number
of which are published in this work. The position of the legs in the
drawings praised is doubtless fortuitous. The Indian in his delineation
of horses cared little more than to show an animal with the appropriate
mane, tail, and hoofs, and the legs were extended without the slightest
regard to natural motion. The drawing of the Indians closely resembles
the masterly abstractions of the living forms devised by the early
heraldic painters which later were corrupted by an attempt to compromise
with zoölogy, resulting in a clumsy naturalism if not caricature.</p>

<p>A comparison of artistic rather than of pictographic skill may frequently
be made, for instance the art of the Haida in carving, which
shows remarkable similarity to that in Central and South America,
and made public by Habel, op. cit., and H. H. Bancroft (<i>i</i>).</p>

<p>The style of drawing is strongly influenced by the material on which
it is made. This topic must receive some consideration here, though
too extensive for full treatment. The substances on which and the instruments
by which pictographs are made in America are discussed in
Chaps. <a href="#page205">VII</a> and <a href="#page218">VIII</a> of this work, and the remarks and illustrations
there presented apply generally to other forms of drawing and painting.
Examples of drawing on every kind of material known to the
American aborigines appear in this work. Carving, pecking, and
scratching of various kinds of rock are illustrated, also paintings on
skins and on wood. The Innuit carving on walrus ivory, of which
numerous illustrations are furnished, is notable for its minuteness as
well as distinctness. The substance was precious, the working surface
limited, and the workmanship required time and care. Birch bark, common
in the whole of the northern Algonquian region, was an attractive
material. It was used much more freely and was worked more easily
than walrus ivory, and in two modes, one in which outlines are drawn
by any hard-pointed substance on the inner side of the bark when it
is soft and which remain permanent when dry, the other made by
scraping on the rough outer surface, thus producing a difference in color.
Many examples of the first-mentioned method are shown throughout
this work, and of the latter in Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page225">XVI</a></span> and Fig. <a href="#page473">659</a>. Having before
them this large collection of varied illustrations readers can judge for
themselves of the effect of the material in determining the style among
people who had substantially the same concepts.</p>

<p>It is universally admitted that the material used, whether papyrus
or parchment, stone or wood, palm leaves or metal, wax or clay, and
the appropriate instruments, hammer, knife, graver, brush or pen, decided
the special style of incipient artists throughout the world. The
Chinese at first worked with knives on bamboo and stone, and even
after they had obtained paper, ink, and fine hair pencils, the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page743" id="page743">[743]</a></span>
of the old method continued. The cuneiform characters are due to the
shape of the wooden style used to impress the figures on unbaked clay.
It may generally be remarked that in materials having a decided
“grain,” of which bamboo is the most obvious instance, the early stage
of art with its rude implements was forced to work in lines running

</div>

<p>Dr. Andree (<i>e</i>) gives the illustration presented here as Fig. 1256 with
these remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The advances made by the Kanakas of New Caledonia in drawing are illustrated
by the bamboo staves covered with engraved drawings, which they carry about as
objects of fashion, somewhat as we
do our walking sticks, and a number
of which are preserved in the
ethnographic museum of Paris
(Trocadero). They have been described
by E. T. Hamy. In these
finely incised drawings ornaments
of the simplest kind (straight lines
and zigzag models) are combined
with figures and tree groups. The
artistic execution is a rather primitive
one, yet the figures by no
means lack character and vividness.
There are seen on the bamboo
the pointed-roofed huts of the
chieftains, turtles, fowl, lizards,
and between them scenes from the
life of the Kanakas. A man beats
his wife, men discharge their bows,
others stand idle in rank and file, adorned with the cylindric straw hat described
by Cook, which at this day has almost entirely disappeared.</p></div>

<p>The explanation of many peculiar forms of Indian drawing and painting
is to be found in the stage of mythologic sophiology reached by the
several tribes. For instance, Mr. W. H. Holmes, op. cit., discovered that
in Chiriqui all the decorations originated in life forms of animals, none
being vegetal and none clearly expressive of the human figure or attempting
the portrayal of physiognomy. This peculiarity doubtless
arose from the exclusively zoomorphic character of the religion of the
people. Other mythologic concepts have given a special trend to the
art of other tribes and peoples. This results in conventionalism. The
sculptures of Persia chiefly express the power and glory of the God-King,
and the Egyptian statues are canonical idealizations of an abstract
human being, type of the race. It is to be noticed that Indians
also show conservatism and conventionalization in their ordinary pictures.
Within what may be called a tribal, or more properly stock,
system, every Indian draws in precisely the same manner. The figures
of a man, of a horse, and of every other object delineated are made by
everyone who attempts to make any such figure, with seeming desire
for all the identity of which their mechanical skill is capable, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="page744" id="page744">[744]</a></span>
showing their conception and motive to be the same. In this respect
the drawing of the Indians may be likened to that of boys at a public
school, who are always drawing, and drawing the same objects and with
constant repetition of the same errors from one school generation to
another.</p>

<p>In discussing artistic skill only in its relation to picture-writing the
degree of its excellence is not intrinsically important, though it may be
so for comparison and identification. The figures required were the
simplest. Among these were vertical and horizontal straight lines and
their combinations, circles, squares, triangles, a hand, a foot, an ax or
a bow, a boat or a sledge. Both natural and artificial objects were
drawn by a few strokes without elaboration. The fewer the marks the
more convenient was the pictograph, if it fulfilled its object of being
recognized by the reader. The simple fact without esthetic effect was
all that the pictographic artists wanted to show, and when an animal
was represented it was not by imitation of its whole form, but by emphasis
of some characteristic which must be made obvious, even if it
distorted the figure or group and violated every principle of art as now
developed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<span class="subhead">MEANS OF INTERPRETATION.</span></h2>


<p>The power of determining the authorship of pictographs made on
materials other than rocks, by means of their general style and type,
can be estimated by a comparison of those of the Abnaki, Ojibwa,
Dakota, Haida, Innuit, Shoshoni, Moki, etc., presented in various parts
of this paper.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1257.</span>&mdash;Typical character.
Guiana.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Everard F. im Thurn (<i>k</i>), in reference to Fig. 1257, remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Wherever a peculiar, complex, and not very obvious figure occurs in many
examples it is legitimate to assume that this had some ulterior object and meaning.
Now this figure, occurring in the shallow engravings of Guiana, is of such kind.
It is not a figure which an Indian would be likely to invent
in an idle moment even once, for such a man very seldom,
probably never, except in these particular figures, has been
known to draw straight lines. Moreover, even if it were a
figure that one Indian might idly invent, it is certainly highly
improbable that this would be copied by many other Indians
in various places. And, lastly, a figure strikingly like the
one in question, if, indeed, it is not identical, occurs in certain
Mexican picture writings. For example, in the Mexican
MSS. [reproduced in Kingsborough, <i>op. cit.</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, from Sir
Thomas Bodley’s MSS., pp. 22, 23, and from the Selden MSS.,
also in the Bodleian, p. 3] several figures occur so like that of
the shallow engravings of Guiana that there can be but little
doubt of their connection. The recurrence of this peculiar
figure in these writings is surely sufficient evidence of the
fact that they are not without intention. If it were possible to obtain a clue to the
meaning of the Mexican figures it might serve as a key to decipher the hieroglyphic
writings of Guiana.</p></div>

<p>With regard to the study of the individual characters themselves to
identify the delineators of pictographs, the various considerations of
fauna, religion, customs, tribal signs, indeed most of the headings of
this paper, will be applicable.</p>

<p>It is convenient to divide this chapter into: 1. Marked characters
of known significance. 2. Distinctive costumes, weapons, and ornaments.
3. Ambiguous characters, with ascertained meaning.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">MARKED CHARACTERS OF KNOWN SIGNIFICANCE.</span></h3>

<p>It is obvious that before attempting the interpretation of pictographs
concerning which no direct information is to be obtained, there should
be a collection, as complete as possible, of known characters, in
order that through them the unknown may be learned. When any
considerable number of objects in a pictograph are actually known the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page746" id="page746">[746]</a></span>
remainder may be ascertained by the context, the relation, and the
position of the several designs, and sometimes by the recognized principles
of the art.</p>

<p>The present writer has been engaged, therefore, for a considerable
time in collating a large number of characters in a card-catalogue
arranged primarily by similarity in forms, and in attaching to each
character any significance ascertained or suggested. As before explained,
the interpretation upon which reliance is mainly based is that
which has been made known by direct information from Indians who
themselves were actually makers of pictographs at the time of giving
the interpretation. Apart from the comparisons obtained by this collation,
the only mode of ascertaining the meaning of the characters, in
other words, the only key yet discovered, is in the study of the gesture
sign included in many of them.</p>

<p>A spiral line frequently seen in petroglyphs is explained by the
Dakota to be a snail shell, and, furthermore, this device is seen in Pl.
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page266">XX</a></span>, and fully described in that connection as used in the recording
and computation of time.</p>

<p>The limits of this paper do not allow of presenting a complete list of
the characters in the pictographs which have become known. But some
of the characters in the petroglyphs,
Figs. 1258, 1259, and 1260, which are not
discussed under various headings, supra,
should be explained. The following
is a selection of those which were interpreted
to Mr. Gilbert.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 329px;">
<img src="images/dp881_pg746a.png" width="329" height="160" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1258.</span>&mdash;Moki devices.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The left hand device of Fig. 1258 is an inclosure, or pen, in which
ceremonial dances are performed. That on the right is a headdress
used in ceremonial dances.</p>

<p>Compare the drawing from Fairy Rocks, N. S., Fig. 549.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1259.</span>&mdash;Frames and arrows. Moki.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 1259 gives sketches of the frames or sticks used in carrying
wood on the back; also shows different forms of arrows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/dp881_pg746c.png" width="600" height="103" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1260.</span>&mdash;Blossoms. Moki.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 1260 represents the blossoms of melons, squashes.</p>

<p>The appearance of objects showing the influence of European civilization
and christianization should always be carefully noted. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="page747" id="page747">[747]</a></span>
instance where an object of that character is found among a multitude
of others not liable to such suspicion is in the heart surmounted by a
cross, in the upper line of Fig. <a href="#page330">437</a>. This suggests missionary teaching
and corresponding date.</p>

<p>Maximilian of Wied (<i>g</i>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Another mode of painting their robes by the Dakotas is to represent the number
of valuable presents they have made. By these presents, which are often of great
value, they acquire reputation and respect among their countrymen. On such robes
we observed long red figures with a black circle at the termination placed close to
each other in transverse rows; they represent whips, indicating the number of
horses given, because the whip belonging to the horse is always bestowed with the
animal. Red or dark-blue transverse figures indicate cloth or blankets given;
parallel transverse stripes represent firearms, the outlines of which are pretty correctly
drawn.</p></div>

<p>It may be desirable also to note, to avoid misconception, that where,
throughout this work, mention is made of particulars under the headings
of customs, religion, etc., which might be made the subject of
graphic illustration in pictographs, and for that reason should be known
as preliminary to the attempted interpretation of the latter, the suggestion
is not given as a mere hypothesis. Such objective marks and
conceptions of the character indicated which can readily be made
objective, are in fact frequently found in pictographs and have been
understood by means of the preliminary information to which reference
is made. When interpretations obtained through this line of study
are properly verified, they can take places in the card catalogue little
inferior to those of interpretations derived directly from aboriginal
pictographers.</p>

<p>The interpretation by means of gesture-signs has already been discussed,
Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVIII</span>, Sec. <a href="#page637">4</a>.</p>

<p>Capt. Carver (<i>b</i>) describes how an Ojibwa drew the emblem of his
own tribe as a deer, a Sioux as a man dressed in skins, an Englishman
as a human figure with a hat on his head, and a Frenchman as a man
with a handkerchief tied around his head.</p>

<p>In this connection is the quotation from the Historical Collections
of Louisiana, Part <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span>, 1851, p. 124, describing a pictograph, as follows:
“There were two figures of men without heads, and some entire. The
first denoted the dead and the second the prisoners. One of my conductors
told me on this occasion that when there are any French
among either, they set their arms akimbo, or their hands upon their
hips, to distinguish them from the savages, whom they represent with
their arms hanging down. This distinction is not purely arbitrary; it
proceeds from these people having observed that the French often put
themselves in this posture, which is not used among them.”</p>

<p>It is also said suggestively, by C. H. Read (<i>f</i>) in Jour. of the Anthrop.
Inst. of Gr. Br. and I., that in the carvings of the West African negroes,
the typical white man is constantly figured with a brandy bottle in one
hand and a large glass in the other.</p>

<p>Instructive particulars regarding pictographs may be discovered in
the delineation of the fauna in
reference to its present or former
habitat in the region where the
representation of it is found.</p>

<p>As an example of the number
and kind of animals pictured as
well as of their mode of representation,
the foregoing Fig. 1261,
comprising many of the Moki
inscriptions at Oakley Springs,
Arizona, is presented by Mr. G.
K. Gilbert. These were selected
by him from a large number of
etchings for the purpose of obtaining
the explanation, and they were explained to him by Tubi, an Oraibi
chief living at Oraibi, one of the Moki villages.</p>

<p>The large object in Fig. 1262, scratched on the Kejimkoojik rocks,
Nova Scotia, is probably intended for a mantis or “rear-horse,” but
strongly reminds the observer of the monkey forms in the petroglyphs
of Central and South America.</p>

<p>Ten Kate (<i>b</i>) shows in Fig. 1263 those animal forms which were not
obliterated from the face of the rock of El-Sauce, Sonora; they were
very nearly in the order in which they are represented. The fish at
the upper right hand is 20 centimeters long.</p>


<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">DISTINCTIVE COSTUMES, WEAPONS, AND ORNAMENTS.</span></h3>

<p>On examining the relics of ancient peoples or their modern representatives,
the instruments and arms accompanying them and the
clothing upon them mark the social status of the individual. In the
social life of past generations, and still to-day, certain garments with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page750" id="page750">[750]</a></span>
their adjuncts indicate certain functions. The lawyer, the mechanic,
the priest, and the soldier are easily recognizable. These garments do
not only give general indications, but minute details, so in looking upon
a certain soldier it is known what country he serves, how many men
are under his orders, and how many chiefs are above him. It is known
if he marches on horseback or afoot, if he handles the rifle or the saber,
works the cannon, designs fortifications, or builds bridges. Also, by
looking on his decorated breast, it is shown if he has made campaigns
and participated in historic battles, and whether or not he has gained
distinction. This is told by the color, cut, and ornaments of his clothes
and by the weapon he bears. Some details are also furnished by the
cut of the hair, and even the style of foot-gear. The above remarks
apply to the highest civilization, but all kinds of personal and class
designations by means of distinctive costumes, weapons, and adornments
were and still are most apparent and important among the less
cultured peoples.</p>

<p>The American Indians seldom clothed themselves, except in very
cold weather, save for purposes of ornament. They habitually wore
no other garment than the breech-cloth, but in their ceremonies and
social dances they bedecked themselves with full and elaborate costumes,
often regulated with special punctilio for the occasion. The boreal
tribes, such as the Alaskan, Athapascan, and Chippewayan, who were
obliged to protect themselves for a large part of the year by furs and
skins, developed characteristic forms of dress which in pictography
take the place occupied by painting and tattooing among tribes where
the person was more habitually exposed. Among the southern tribes
there was need of protection against the rays of the sun, as in Mexico,
where cotton and other fibers were used. In general some of the forms
of wearing apparel, if only varieties in the make of moccasins or sandals,
designated the tribe of the wearers, and therefore often became
adopted as pictorial signs. Ceremonial clothing is often elaborately
decorated with beads, porcupine quills, claws and teeth of animals,
shells, and feathers. Many of these garments are further ornamented
with paintings of a totemic or mythologic character, or bear the insignia
of the wearer’s rank and social status.
Metal ornaments, such as armlets, bracelets,
anklets, earrings and bells, were also worn,
the material and quantity being in accordance
with the wearer’s ability and pecuniary
condition. Upon both social and ceremonial
occasions the headgear displayed
eagle feathers and the plumes of other species
of birds, and tufts of hair dyed in red or
other colors. Necklaces were made of claws,
shells, deer and antelope hoofs, the teeth of
various animals, snake-skins, and even human fingers.</p>

were made from shells which in their natural
shape are innumerable; from the skins of animals
which require only skill to take and dress
them; and from stone and copper, demanding
only strength to procure and transport them.
The value of an Indian ornament is in the skill, care and patience required
in making it. Thus the wampum-bead became of intrinsic value,
similar in that to gold and silver in civilization; the stone carefully
wrought into the fashion of a pipe became the emblem of authority
and the instrument of worship; and copper, slowly and toilfully delved
and fashioned with the rudest of tools and appliances, became almost
a fetich of superstition. So likewise the quill of the porcupine, worked
into a design in embroidery with the most exquisite care, was an ornament
fit for warriors and chiefs. But on the cradle or basket-nest for
the expected or new-born child, upon the gown or woman’s dress of the
favorite daughter, and upon the moccasins and trappings for the growing
son, hand and head and heart were employed for months and even years.</p>

<p>The Dakotan bride, swayed by the yearning of expectant maternity,
perhaps also by ambition to excel in the sole permitted mode of its
display, adorned her lodge with ornamented cradles, each new one
becoming in design more beautiful and intricate than the last, until
her yearning was answered, when the cradles not needed were exchanged
for horses and ornaments, which became the endowment of
the new-born child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page753" id="page753">[753]</a></span></p>

<p>Some note should be made of the sense of correspondence and contrast
of colors which the Dakota, at least, exhibits; the rules which
he originates and observes forming that which is called artistic taste.
The Indian’s use of colors corresponds more nearly than that of most
barbarians with that common in high civilization, except that he perceives
so little distinction between blue and green that but one name
generally suffices for both colors. It is remarkable that among the
wilder and plains tribes of Dakotas dead colors in beads are preferred
and arranged with good effect, and that among these, specially, the use
of neutral tints is common. Probably both of these results were produced
from the old and exclusive employment of clays for pigments&mdash;clays
of almost all colors and shades being found in the country over
which the Dakotas roamed.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of dress or undress would seem to have first struck
the people of the eastern hemisphere as well adapted to pictorial representation.
Singularly enough to modern ideas, the braccæ or trousers
were to the Romans the symbol of barbarism, whereas now the absence
of the garments, called even “indispensable,” has the same significance.
Maj. C. R. Conder (<i>d</i>) gives this good lesson literally “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a propos de bottes</span>:”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A curious peculiarity of dress also serves to indicate the racial connection. In
Cappadocia and in Anatolia the monuments represent figures with a boot or shoe
curled up in front. An Assyrian representation of an Armenian merchant shows the
same boot. Sir C. Wilson first compared it with the boot now worn by the peasantry
of Asia Minor. Perrot compares it with the cavalry boot worn
in Syria and with what we call a Turkish slipper. The Etruscans
wore a similar shoe called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">calceus repandus</span> by the Romans. On
the monuments at Karnak the Hittites are represented wearing
the same shoe, and although it is not of necessity a mark of race,
it is still curious that this curly-toed boot was common to the
various Turanian peoples of Syria, Asia Minor, Armenia, and
Italy.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1280.</span> Australian wommeras and clubs.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It may be well to insert here Fig. 1280, showing the wommeras and
clubs of the Australians, taken from Curr (<i>d</i>), not only on account of
their forms but of the pictorial designs on some of them, which should
be compared with those of the Moki and other Indian tribes.</p>

<p>A large number of pictographic figures distinguishing bodies of Indians
by different mode of head dress have already been given. Some
additional detail may be added about the Absaroka who have in this
regard been imitated by the Hidatsa and Arikara.</p>

<p>They wear horse hair taken from the tail, attached to the back of their
heads and allowed to hang down their backs. It is arranged in eight
or ten strands, each about as thick as a finger and laid parallel with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page754" id="page754">[754]</a></span>
spaces between them of the width of a single strand. Pine gum is then
mixed with red ocher or vermilion and by means of other hair, or
fibers of any kind laid crosswise, the strands are secured and around
each intersection of hair a ball of gum is plastered to hold it in place,
secured to the real growth of hair on the back of the head. About four
inches further down a similar row of gum balls and cross strings is
placed, and so on down to the end. The Indians frequently incorporate
the false hair with their own so as to lengthen the latter without
any marked evidence of the deception. Nevertheless the transverse
fastenings with their gum attachments are present. In picture-writing
this is shown upon the figure of a man by parallel lines drawn downward
from the back of the head, intersected by cross lines, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="page755" id="page755">[755]</a></span>
appearing like small squares or a piece of net. See Figs. <a href="#page380">484</a> and <a href="#page380">485</a>,
supra.</p>

<p>A quaint account of social designation by the arrangement of the
hair among the Northeastern Algonquins is recorded in the Jesuit Relations
of 1639, pp. 44-5:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When a girl or woman favors some one who seeks her, she cuts the hair in the
fashion adopted by the maidens of France, hanging over the forehead, which is an
ugly style as well in this country as in France; St. Paul forbidding women to show
their hair. The women here wear their hair in bunches at the back of the head, in
the form of a truss, which they decorate with beads when they have them. If, after
marrying some one, a woman leaves him without cause, or if, being promised and
having accepted some present, she fails to keep her word, the presumptive husband
sometimes cuts her hair, which renders her very despicable and prevents her from
getting another spouse.</p></div>

<p>There is a differentiation of this usage among the Pueblos generally,
who, when accurate and particular in delineation, designate the women
of that tribe by a huge coil of hair over either ear. This custom prevails
also among the Coyotèro Apaches, the women wearing the hair
in a coil to denote a virgin, while the coil is absent in the case of a
married woman.</p>

<p>Regarding the apparent subject matter of pictographs an obvious
distinction may be made between hunting and land scenes such as
would be familiar to interior tribes and those showing fishing and
aquatic habits common to seaboard and lacustrine peoples. Similar
and more perspicuous modes of discrimination are available. The general
scope of known history, traditions, and myths may also serve in
identification. Known habits and fashions of existing or historically-known
tribes have the same application, e. g., the portrayal on a drawing
of a human face of labrets or nose rings limits the artist to defined
regions, and then other considerations may further specify the work.</p>

<p>When the specific pictorial style of distinctive peoples is ascertained
its appearance on rocks may give evidence of their habitat and migrations,
and on the other hand their authorship of the petroglyphs being
received as a working hypothesis, the latter may be confirmed and the
characters interpreted through the known practices and habits of the
postulated authors.</p>


<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">AMBIGUOUS CHARACTERS WITH ASCERTAINED MEANING.</span></h3>

<p>Under this heading specimens of the card catalogue before mentioned
are presented. The characters would not probably be recognized for
the objects they are intended to represent and many of them might be
mistaken for attempts to delineate other objects. A much larger number
of similar delineations are to be found under other headings in this
work, especially in Chap. <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#page376">XIII</a></span> on Totems, titles, and names.</p>

of the last one they are copies of selected sketches made by Gaga
Sindebi at White Earth, Minn., in 1891, as parts of a Midē' song.</p>

<p><i>a</i>, a wolf. The dark chest markings and the large tail are in imitation
of those parts of the timber wolf. The coyote is not now found
in the region where the author of the song lives; but is more particularly
a prairie animal.</p>

<p><i>b</i>, a wolf. The pronounced jaw indicates his carnivorous nature.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, a badger. Although the form resembles that of the bear the difference
is shown by the darkened body to imitate the gray fur.</p>

<p><i>d</i>, a bear.</p>

and stout, while the legs and ears are unusually pronounced.</p>

<p><i>f</i>, the figure of a bear manido, to which is attached a feather denoting
the mythic character of the animal.</p>

<p><i>g</i>, the figure represents a “lean bear,” as is specified by the appearance
of the ribs showing his lean condition.</p>

<p><i>h</i>, a lizard. The ribs are ridges, which are found upon some forms
of <i>Siredon</i>, one species of which occurs in the ponds and small lakes

<p><i>k</i>, a raccoon. The bands of color are indicated in the drawing.</p>

<p><i>l</i>, a porcupine. Resembles some forms of the sacred bear manido as
the latter is sometimes drawn.</p>

<p><i>m</i>, the crane. The three round spots over the head represent three
songs sung by the midē' to the crane manido.</p>

<p><i>n</i>, the thunder-bird or eagle, having four heads. This character
appears to be unique, as it has at no time been noticed upon any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page758" id="page758">[758]</a></span>
numerous midē' records in the possession of the Bureau of Ethnology.</p>

<p><i>o</i>, the character represents a man using the rattle, as in the ceremony
of incantation. The projections above the head denote his superior
powers.</p>

<p><i>p</i>, a midē', holding in his right hand a bear’s paw medicine bag, and
in his left hand an arrow. The character resembles similar drawings
to denote vessels in which herbs are boiled and from the top of which
vapor is issuing.</p>

<p><i>q</i>, a midē' medicine sack. The character appears like similar drawings
of the otter; in the present instance, however, the ornamentation
upon the skin shows it to be not a living animal.</p>

<p><i>r</i>, a beaver’s tail, from Schoolcraft (<i>y</i>). Many other illustrations of
this general nature are given by Mr. Schoolcraft, nearly all colored
according to his fancy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<span class="subhead">CONTROVERTED PICTOGRAPHS.</span></h2>


<p>No large amount of space need be occupied in the mention of
detected pictographic frauds, their present and future importance
being small, but much more than is now allowed would be required
for the full discussion of controverted cases.</p>

<p>There is little inducement, beyond the amusement derived from
hoaxing, to commit actual frauds in the fabrication of petroglyphs.
It must, however, be remembered that coloration and carving of a
deceptive character are sometimes produced by natural causes, e. g.,
pictured rocks on the island of Monhegan, Maine, figured by Schoolcraft
(<i>z</i>), are classed in “Science” VI, No. 132, p. 124, as freaks of
surface erosion. Mica plates were found in a mound at Lower Sandusky,
Ohio, which, after some attempts at interpretation, proved to belong to
the material known as graphic or hieroglyphic mica, the discolorations
having been caused by the infiltration of mineral solution between the
laminæ.</p>

<p>The instances where inscribed stones from mounds have been ascertained
to be forgeries or fictitious drawings are to be explained as
sometimes produced by simple mischief, sometimes by craving for personal
notoriety, and in other cases by schemes either to increase the
marketable value of land supposed to contain more of the articles or
to sell those exhibited.</p>

<p>With regard to more familiar and more portable articles, such as
engraved pipes, painted robes, and like curios, it is well known that
the fancy prices paid for them by amateurs have stimulated their
unlimited manufacture by Indians at agencies who make a business of
sketching upon ordinary robes or plain pipes the characters in common
use by them, without regard to any real event or person, and
selling them as significant records. Some enterprising traders have
been known to furnish the unstained robes, plain pipes, paints, and
other materials for the purpose, and simply pay a skillful Indian for
his work, when the fresh antique or imaginary chronicle is delivered.</p>

<p>As the business of making and selling archæologic frauds has become
so extensive in Egypt and Palestine, it can be no matter of surprise
that it has been attempted by enterprising people of the United States,
about whom the wooden-nutmeg imputation still clings. The Bureau
of Ethnology has discovered several centers of the manufacture of antiquities.</p>

<p>It was once proclaimed that six inscribed copper plates had been
found in a mound near Kinderhook, Pike county, Illinois, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page760" id="page760">[760]</a></span>
reported to bear a close resemblance to Chinese. This resemblance
seemed not to be extraordinary when it was ascertained that the plate
had been engraved by the village blacksmith, copied from the lid of a
Chinese tea-chest.</p>

<p>The following recent notice of a case of alleged fraud is quoted from
Science, Vol. III, No. 58, March 14, 1884, page 334:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. N. Roe Bradner exhibited [at the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania] an inscribed stone found inside a skull taken from one of the ancient
mounds at Newark, Ohio, in 1865. An exploration of the region had been undertaken,
in consequence of the finding of stones bearing markings somewhat resembling
Hebrew letters, in the hope of finding other specimens of a like character.
The exploration was supposed to have been entirely unproductive of such objects
until Dr. Bradner had found the engraved stone, now exhibited, in a skull which
had been given to him.</p></div>

<p>This was supplemented by an editorial note in No. 62 of the same
publication, page 467, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A correspondent from Newark, Ohio, warns us that any inscribed stones said to
originate from that locality may be looked upon as spurious. Years ago certain
parties in that place made a business of manufacturing and burying inscribed
stones and other objects in the autumn, and exhuming them the following spring in
the presence of innocent witnesses. Some of the parties to these frauds afterwards
confessed to them; and no such objects, except such as were spurious, have ever
been known from that region.</p></div>

<p>The correspondent of Science probably remembered the operations of
David Wyrick, of Newark, who, to prove his theory that the Hebrews
were the mound-builders, discovered in 1860 a tablet bearing on one
side a truculent “likeness” of Moses with his name in Hebrew, and on
the other a Hebrew abridgment of the ten commandments. A Hebrew
bible afterwards found in Mr. Wyrick’s private room threw some light
on the inscribed characters.</p>

<p>A grooved stone ax or maul, first described by the late Dr. John
Evans, of Pemberton, New Jersey, was reproduced by Dr. Wilson (<i>a</i>).
Several characters are cut in the groove and on the blade. They are
neither Runic, Scandinavian, nor Anglo-Saxon. It was found near
Pemberton, New Jersey, prior to 1859. Dr. E. H. Davis, who saw the
stone, does not regard the inscription as ancient. The characters had
been retouched before he saw them.</p>

<p>A grooved stone ax or maul, sent to Col. Whittlesey in 1874, from
Butler county, Ohio, about the size of the Pemberton ax, was covered
with English letters so fresh as to deceive no one versed in antiquities.
The purport of this inscription is that in 1689 Capt. H. Argill passed
there and secreted two hundred bags of gold near a spring.</p>

<p>It was claimed that an inscribed stone had been plowed up on the
eastern shore of Grand Traverse bay, Michigan, and an imperfect cast
of it was among the collections of the state of Michigan at the Centennial
Exhibition. The original is or was in the cabinet of the Kent
county Institute, Grand Rapids, Michigan. It is imperfectly executed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page761" id="page761">[761]</a></span>
probably with a knife, and evidently of recent make, in which
Greek, Bardic, and fictitious letters are jumbled together without order.</p>

<p>In 1875 a stone maul was discovered in an ancient mine pit near
Lake Desor, Isle Royal, Lake Superior, on which were cut several
lines that were at first regarded as letters.</p>

<p>An instructive paper by Mr. Wm. H. Holmes “On Some Spurious
Mexican Antiquities and their Relation to Ancient Art,” is published
in the Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1886, Pt. 1, pp. 319-334.</p>


<h3>SECTION 1.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE GRAVE CREEK STONE.</span></h3>

<p>An inscribed stone found in Grave creek mound, near the Ohio
river, in 1838, has been the subject of much linguistic contention among
persons who admitted its authenticity. Twenty-four characters on it
have been considered by various experts to be alphabetic, and one is
a supposed hieroglyphic sign. Mr. Schoolcraft says that twenty-two
of the characters are alphabetic, but there has been a difference of opinion
with regard to their origin. One scholar finds among them four characters
which he claims are ancient Greek; another claims that four are
Etruscan; five have been said to be Runic; six, ancient Gaelic; seven,
old Erse; ten, Phenician; fourteen, old British; and sixteen, Celtiberic.
M. Levy Bing reported at the Congress of Americanists at Nancy,
in 1875, that he found in the inscription twenty-three Canaanite letters,
and translated it: “What thou sayest, thou dost impose it, thou shinest
in thy impetuous clan and rapid chamois.” (!) M. Maurice Schwab in
1857 rendered it: “The Chief of Emigration who reached these places
(or this island) has fixed these statutes forever.” M. Oppert, however,
gave additional variety by the translation, so that all tastes can be
suited: “The grave of one who was assassinated here. May God to
avenge him strike his murderer, cutting off the hand of his existence.”</p>

<p>Col. Chas. Whittlesey (<i>a</i>) gives six copies of the Grave creek stone,
all purporting to be facsimiles, which have been published and used
in the elaborate discussions held upon its significance. Of these, three
are here reproduced with Col. Whittlesey’s remarks, as follows:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/dp896_pg761.jpg" width="280" height="225" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1285.</span>&mdash;Grave creek stone.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Copy No. 1 is reproduced as Fig. 1285, drawn by Capt. Eastman.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Capt. Seth Eastman was a graduate and teacher of drawing at West Point. He
was an accomplished draftsman and painter detailed
by the War Department to furnish the illustrations
for “Schoolcraft’s Indian Tribes,” published by the
Government. This copy was made in his official capacity,
with the stone before him, and therefore takes the
first rank as authority. There are between the lines
twenty-two characters, but one is repeated three times
and another twice leaving only twenty. The figure, if
it has any significance, is undoubtedly pictorial.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page762" id="page762">[762]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 231px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1286.</span>&mdash;Grave creek stone.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Copy No. 3, now Fig. 1286, was used by Monsieur Jomard at Paris,
1843.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From this copy M. Jomard considered the letters to
be Lybian, a language derived from the Phenician. At
the right of the upper line one is omitted and another
bears no resemblance to the original. The fifth character
of the second line is equally defective and objectionable.
The second, fifth, and sixth of the lower line
are little better. In the rude profile of a human face
beneath an eye has been introduced and the slender
cross lines attached to it have assumed the proportions
of a dagger or sword. For the linguist or ethnologist
this copy is entirely worthless.</p></div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 232px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1287.</span>&mdash;Grave creek stone.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Copy No. 4, now Fig. 1287, was sent to Prof. Rafn, Copenhagen, 1843.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is so imperfect and has so many additions that it is little better than a burlesque
upon the original. No one will be surprised that the learned Danish antiquarian
could find in it no resemblance to the Runic,
with which he was thoroughly familiar.</p></div>

<p>A mere collocation of letters from various
alphabets is not an alphabet. Words can not
be formed or ideas communicated by that artifice.
When a people adopts the alphabetical
signs of another it adopts the general style
of the characters and more often the characters
in detail. Such signs had already an
arrangement into syllables and words which had a vocalic validity as
well as known significance. A jumble of letters from a variety of
alphabets bears internal evidence that the manipulator did not have an
intelligent meaning to convey by them, and did not comprehend the languages
from which the letters were selected. In the case of the Grave
creek inscription the futile attempts to extract a meaning from it on
the theory that it belongs to an intelligent alphabetic system show
that it holds no such place. If it is genuine it must be treated as
pictorial and ideographic, unless, indeed, it is cryptographic, which is
not indicated.</p>


<h3>SECTION 2.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE DIGHTON ROCK.</span></h3>

<p>In this connection some allusion must be made to the learned discussions
upon the Dighton rock before mentioned, p. <a href="#page086">86</a>. The originally
Algonquian characters were translated by a Scandinavian antiquary as
an account of the party of Thorfinn, the Hopeful. A distinguished
Orientalist made out clearly the word “melek” (king). Another scholar
triumphantly established the characters to be Scythian, and still
another identified them as Phenician. But this inscription has been
so manipulated that it is difficult now to determine the original details.</p>

<p>An official report made in 1830 by the Rhode Island Historical
Society and published by the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page763" id="page763">[763]</a></span>
in “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiquitates Americanæ</span>,” by C. C. Rafn (<i>e</i>), presents the best
account known concerning the Dighton rock and gives copies made
from time to time of the inscription, which are here reproduced, Pl. <span class="smcap lowercase">LIV</span>.
The text is condensed as follows, but in quoting it the statement that
the work was not done by the Indians is without approval.</p>

<p>DIGHTON ROCK.</p></div>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is situated about 6&frac12; miles south of Taunton, on the east side of Taunton river,
a few feet from the shore, and on the west side of Assonet neck, in the town of
Berkley, county of Bristol, and commonwealth of Massachusetts; although probably
from the fact of being generally visited from the opposite side of the river, which is
in Dighton, it has always been known by the name of the Dighton Writing Rock.
It faces northwest toward the bed of the river, and is covered by the water 2 or 3
feet at the highest, and is left 10 or 12 feet from it at the lowest tides; it is also
completely immersed twice in twenty-four hours. The rock does not occur in situ,
but shows indubitable evidence of having occupied the spot where it now rests since
the period of that great and extensive disruption which was followed by the transportation
of immense bowlders to, and a deposit of them in, places at a vast distance
from their original beds. It is a mass of well characterized, fine grained graywacke.
Its true color, as exhibited by a fresh fracture, is a bluish gray. There is no rock in
the immediate neighborhood that would at all answer as a substitute for the
purpose for which the one bearing the inscription was selected, as they are aggregates
of the large conglomerate variety. Its face, measured at the base is 11&frac12;
feet, and in height it is a little rising 5 feet. The upper surface forms with the
horizon an inclined plane of about 60 degrees. The whole of the face is covered to
within a few inches of the ground with unknown hieroglyphics. There appears
little or no method in the arrangement of them. The lines are from half an inch to
an inch in width; and in depth, sometimes one-third of an inch, though generally
very superficial. They were, inferring from the rounded elevations and intervening
depressions, pecked in upon the rock and not chiseled or smoothly cut out. The
marks of human power and manual labor are indelibly stamped upon it. No one
who examines attentively the workmanship will believe it to have been done by
the Indians. Moreover, it is a well attested fact that nowhere throughout our
widespread domain is a single instance of their recording or having recorded their
deeds or history on stone.</p>

<p>“The committee also examined the various drawings that have been made of this
inscription.</p>

<p>“The first was made by Cotton Mather as early as 1712; and may be found in No.
338, vol. 28, of the Philosophical Transactions, pp. 70 and 71; also in vol. 5, Jones’s
abridgment, under article fourth.</p>

<p>“Another was made by James Winthrop in 1788, a copy of which may be found in
the Memoirs of the American Academy, vol. 2, part 2, p. 126.</p>

<p>“Dr. Baylies and Mr. Goodwin made another drawing in 1790, a copy of which is
inclosed.</p>

<p>“Mr. E. A. Kendall in 1807 took another which may be found in the Memoirs of the
American Academy, vol. 3, part 1, p. 165.</p>

<p>“And one has been more recently [1812] made by Mr. Job Gardner, a lithograph
from which is also inclosed.</p>

<p>“Dr. Isaac Greenwood exhibited a drawing of the inscription before the Society of
Antiquarians of London bearing the date of 1730. The drawing by the Historical
Society of Rhode Island bears the date of 1830.</p>

<p>“We send you a copy of the inscription, as given on said representation of the rock,
being what you probably desire; but having made an accurate drawing of the rock
itself for your special use, we have not deemed it necessary to forward the one above
referred to. We also send a copy of Judge Winthrop’s drawing contained in the same
work, and of one taken by Stephen Sewell in 1768.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page764" id="page764">[764]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will likewise find among the drawings a copy of what purports to be ‘a
faithful and accurate representation of the inscription,’ taken by Dr. Danforth in
1680. This is not sent with any idea that it will prove serviceable in your present
inquiry, but simply to show what strange things have been conjured up by travelers
and sent to Europe for examination. We are, indeed, at times almost compelled to
believe there must have been some other inscription rock seen; and yet from the
accompanying accounts it would appear that all refer to the same one; besides, there
is a degree of similarity in the complicated triangular figures which appear on all.”</p></div>

<p>See, also, the illustration from Schoolcraft, Fig. <a href="#page086">49</a>, supra, with further
account. The fact was mentioned on p. <a href="#page087">87</a> that the characters on
the Dighton Rock strongly resembled those on the Indian God Rock,
Pennsylvania, and some others specified. Lately some observers have
noticed the same fact with a different deduction. They presuppose
that the Dighton inscription is Runic, and therefore that the one in
Pennsylvania was carved by the Norsemen. This logic would bring
the Vikings very far inland into West Virginia and Ohio.</p>


<h3>SECTION 3.<br />

<span class="subhead">IMITATIONS AND FORCED INTERPRETATIONS.</span></h3>

<p>From considerations mentioned elsewhere, and others that are obvious,
any inscriptions purporting to be pre-Columbian, showing apparent
use of alphabetic characters, signs of the zodiac, or other evidences of
a culture higher than that known among the North American Indians,
must be received with caution, but the pictographs may be altogether
genuine, and their erroneous interpretation may be the sole ground for
discrediting them.</p>

<p>The course above explained, viz, to attempt the interpretation of all
unknown American pictographs by the aid of actual pictographers
among the living Indians, should be adopted regarding all remarkable
“finds.” This course was pursued by Mr. Horatio N. Rust, of Pasadena,
California, regarding the much-discussed Davenport Tablets, in
the genuineness of which he believes. Mr. Rust exhibited the drawings
to Dakotas with the result made public at the Montreal meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and also
in a letter, an extract from which is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As I made the acquaintance of several of the older and more intelligent members
of the tribe, I took the opportunity to show them the drawings. Explaining that
they were pictures copied from stones found in a mound, I asked what they meant.
They readily gave me the same interpretation (and in no instance did either interpreter
know that another had seen the pictures, so there could be no collusion). In
Plate I, of the Davenport Inscribed Tablets [so numbered in the Proceedings of the
Davenport Academy, vol. <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>], the lower central figure represents a dome-shaped
lodge, with smoke issuing from the top, behind and to either side of which appears a
number of individuals with hands joined, while three persons are depicted as lying
upon the ground. Upon the right and left central margins are the sun and moon,
the whole surmounted by three arched lines, between each of which, as well as above
them, are numerous unintelligible characters. * * * The central figure, which
has been supposed by some to represent a funeral pile, was simply the picture of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page765" id="page765">[765]</a></span>
dirt lodge. The irregular markings apparently upon the side and to the left of the
lodge represent a fence made of sticks and brush set in the ground. The same style
of fence may be seen now in any Sioux village.</p>

<p>The lines of human figures standing hand-in-hand indicate that a dance was being
conducted in the lodge. The three prostrate forms at right and left sides of the lodge
represent two men and a woman who, being overcome by the excitement and fatigue
of the dance, had been carried out in the air to recover. The difference in the shape
of the prostrate forms indicates the different sexes.</p>

<p>The curling figures or rings above the lodge represent smoke, and indicate that
the dance was held in winter, when fire was used.</p></div>

<p>An amusing example of forced interpretation of a genuine petroglyph
is given by Lieut. J. W. Gunnison (<i>a</i>), and is
presented in the present work in connection with
Fig. <a href="#page117">81</a>, supra.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 129px;">
<a href="images/dp901_pg765h.jpg">
<img src="images/dp901_pg765.jpg" class="hires" width="129" height="550" alt="" />
</a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1288.</span>&mdash;Imitated pictograph.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 1288 is a copy of a drawing taken from
an Ojibwa pipestem, obtained by Dr. Hoffman
from an officer of the United States Army, who
had procured it from an Indian in St. Paul,
Minnesota. On more minute examination, it appeared
that the pipestem had been purchased at
a shop in St. Paul, which had furnished a large
number of similar objects&mdash;so large as to awaken
suspicion that they were in the course of daily
manufacture. The figures and characters on
the pipestem were drawn in colors. In the
present figure, which is without colors, the horizontal
lines represent blue and the vertical red,
according to the heraldic scheme. The outlines
were drawn in a dark neutral tint, in some lines
approaching black; the triangular characters,
representing lodges, being also in a neutral tint,
or an ashen hue, and approaching black in
several instances. The explanation of the figures,
made before there was any suspicion of their
authenticity, is as follows:</p>

<p>The first figure is that of a bear, representing
the person to whom the record pertains. The
heart above the line, according to an expression
in gesture language, would signify a brave heart,
increased numbers indicating much or many, so
that the three hearts mean a large brave heart.</p>

<p>The second figure, a circle inclosing a triradiate
character, refers to the personal totem. The
character in the middle somewhat resembles
the pictograph sometimes representing stars,
though in the latter the lines center upon the
disks and not at a common point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page766" id="page766">[766]</a></span></p>

<p>The seven triangular characters represent the lodges of a village to
which the person referred to belongs.</p>

<p>The serpentine lines immediately below these signify a stream or river,
near which the village is situated.</p>

<p>The two persons holding guns in their left hands, together with
another holding a spear, appear to be the companions of the speaker
or recorder, all of whom are members of the turtle gens, as shown by
that animal.</p>

<p>The curve from left to right is a representation of the sky, the sun
having appeared upon the left or eastern horizon. The drawing, so
far, might represent the morning when a female member of the crane
gens, was killed&mdash;shown by the headless body of a woman.</p>

<p>The lower figure of a bear is the same apparently as the upper,
though turned to the right. The hearts are drawn below the line, i. e.,
down, to denote sadness, grief, remorse, as it would be expressed in
gesture language, and to atone for the misdeed committed the pipe
is brought and offering made for peace.</p>

<p>Altogether the act depicted appears to have been accidental, the
woman belonging to the same tribe, as can be learned from the gens of
which she was a member. The regret or sorrow signified in the bear,
next to the last figure, corresponds with that supposition, as such
feelings would not be manifested on the death of an enemy.</p>

<p>The point of interest in this drawing is, that the figures are very
skillfully copied from the numerous characters of the same kind representing
Ojibwa pictographs, and given by Schoolcraft. The arrangement
of these copied characters is precisely what would be common in
the similar work of Indians. In fact, the group constitutes an intelligent
pictograph and affords a good illustration of the manner in which
one can be made. The fact that it was sold under false representations
is its objectionable feature.</p>

<p>Another case brought officially to the Bureau of Ethnology shows
evidence of a more determined fraud. In 1888 and earlier a so-called
“Shawnee doctor” had displayed as a chart in the nature of an aboriginal
diploma, a brightly colored picture 36 by 40 inches, a copy of
which was sent, to be deciphered, to the Bureau by a gentleman who is
not supposed to have been engaged in fraud or hoax. The mystic chart
is copied in Fig. 1289. There was little difficulty in its explanation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

</a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1289.</span>&mdash;Fraudulent pictograph.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The large figures on the border can not be pretended to be of Indian
origin. The smaller interior figures constituting the body of the chart
are all, with trifling exceptions, exact copies of figures published and
fully explained in G. Copway’s “Traditional History, etc., of the
Ojibway Nation,” op. cit. Several of the same figures appear above in
the present work. The principal exceptions are, first, a modern knife;
second, a bird with a decidedly un-Indian human head, and, third, a
cross with two horizontal arms of equal length. The figures from
Copway are not in the exact order given in his list and it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="page767" id="page767">[767]</a></span>
that they may have been placed in their present order to simulate the
appearance of some connected narrative or communication, which could
readily be done in the same manner as the words of a dictionary could
be cut out and pasted in some intelligent sequence.</p>

<p>Among the curiosities of literature in connection with the interpretation
of pictographs may be mentioned <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vèritè sur le Livre des
Sauvages, par L’Abbé Em. Domenech</span>, Paris, 1861, and Researches into
the Lost Histories of America, by W. S. Blacket, London and Philadelphia,

</div>

<p>The following remarks of Dr. Edkins (<i>h</i>) are also in point:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The early Jesuits were accustomed to interpret Chinese characters on the wildest
principles. They detected religious mysteries in the most unexpected situations.
Kwei “treacherous,” is written with Kieu “nine,” and above it one of the covering
radicals, Fig. 1290<i>a</i>. This, then, was Satan at the
head of the nine ranks of angels. The character, same
Fig., <i>b</i>, c’hwen “a boat,” was believed to contain an
allusion to the deluge. On the left side is the ark and on
the right are the signs for eight and for persons. The
day for this mode of explaining the Chinese characters
has gone by.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<span class="subhead">GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.</span></h2>


<p>The result of the writer’s studies upon petroglyphs as distinct from
other forms of picture writing may now be summarized.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important lesson learned from these studies is that
no attempt should be made at symbolic interpretation unless the symbolic
nature of the particular characters under examination is known,
or can be logically inferred from independent facts. To start with a
theory, or even a hypothesis, that the rock writings are all symbolic
and may be interpreted by the imagination of the observer or by translation
either from or into known symbols of similar form found in other
regions, were a limitless delusion. Doubtless many of the characters
are genuine symbols or emblems, and some have been ascertained
through extrinsic information to be such. Sometimes the more modern
forms are explained by Indians who have kept up the pictographic
practice, and the modern forms occasionally throw light upon the more
ancient. But the rock inscriptions do not evince mysticism or esotericism,
cryptography, or steganography. With certain exceptions they
were intended to be understood by all observers either as rude objective
representations or as ideograms, which indeed were often so imperfect
as to require elucidation, but not by any hermeneutic key. While
they often related to religious ceremonies or myths, such figures were
generally drawn in the same spirit with which any interesting matter
was portrayed.</p>

<p>While the interpretation of petroglyphs by Indians should be obtained
if possible, it must be received with caution. They very seldom
know by tradition the meaning of the older forms, and their inferences
are often made from local and limited pictographic practices. There
is no more conscientious and intelligent Indian authority than Frank
La Flêche, an Omaha, and he explains the marks on a rock in Nebraska
as associated with the figures of deceased men and exhibiting
the object which caused their death, such as an arrow or ax. This may
be a local or tribal practice, but it certainly does not apply to similar
figures throughout the Algonquian and Iroquoian areas, where, according
to the concurrent testimony for more than two centuries,
similar figures are either designations of tribes and associations, or in
their combinations are records of achievements.</p>

<p>Lossing (<i>b</i>) gives the following explanation of markings on a well
known rock:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the brave warriors in the battle [of Maumee] who were the last to flee before
Wayne’s legion, was Me-sa-sa, or Turkey-foot, an Ottawa chief, who lived on
Blanchards Fork of the AuGlaize River. He was greatly beloved by his people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page769" id="page769">[769]</a></span>
His courage was conspicuous. When he found the line of dusky warriors giving
way at the foot of Presque Isle hill, he leaped upon a small bowlder, and by voice
and gesture endeavored to make them stand firm. He almost immediately fell,
pierced by a musket ball, and expired by the side of the rock. * * * They carved
many rude figures of a turkey’s foot on the stone, as a memorial of the English name
of the lamented Me-sa-sa. The stone is still there, by the side of the highway at the
foot of Presque Isle hill, within a few rods of the swift-flowing Maumee. Many of
the carvings are still quite deep and distinct, while others have been obliterated by
the abrasion of the elements.</p></div>

<p>This tale may be true, but it surely does not account for the turkey-foot
marks which are so common in the northeastern Algonquian region,
extending from Dighton rock to Ohio, that they form a typical
characteristic of its pictographs. They have been considered to be the
sign for the bird, the turkey, which was a frequent totem. Lossing’s
story is an example of the readiness of an Indian, when in an amiable
and communicative mood, to answer queries in a manner which he supposes
will be satisfactory to his interviewer. He will then give any
desired amount of information on any subject without the slightest
restriction by the vulgar bounds of fact. It is dangerous to believe
explanations on such subjects as are now under consideration, unless
they are made without leading questions by a number of Indian authorities
independently.</p>

<p>Specially convenient places for halting and resting on a journey, either
by land or water, such as is mentioned supra, on Machias bay, generally
exhibit petroglyphs if rocks of the proper character are favorably situated
there. The markings may be mere graffiti, the product of leisure
hours, or may be of the more serious descriptions mentioned below.</p>

<p>Some points are ascertained with regard to the motives of the
painters and sculptors on rocks. Some of the characters were mere
records of the visits of individuals to important springs or to fords on
regularly established trails. In this practice there may have been in
the intention of the Indians very much the same spirit which induces
the civilized man to record his name or initials upon objects in the
neighborhood of places of general resort. But there was real utility
in the Indian practice, which more nearly approached to the signature
in a visitor’s book at a hotel or public building, both to establish the
identity of the traveler and to give the news to friends of his presence
and passage. At Oakley springs, Arizona territory, totemic marks
have been found, evidently made by the same individual at successive
visits, showing that on the number of occasions indicated he had
passed by those springs, probably camping there, and the habit of
making such record was continued until quite recently by the neighboring
Indians. The same repetition of totemic names has been found
in great numbers in the pipestone quarries of Minnesota, on the rocks
near Odanah, Wisconsin, and also at some old fords in West Virginia.
These totemic marks are so designed and executed as to have intrinsic
significance and value, wholly different in this respect from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page770" id="page770">[770]</a></span>
names in alphabetic form, which grammatically are proper but practically
may be common.</p>

<p>Rock carvings are frequently noticed at waterfalls and other points
on rivers and on lake shores favorable for fishing, which frequency is
accounted for by the periodical resort of Indians to such places. Sometimes
they only mark their stay, but occasionally there also appear to
be records of conflict with rival or inimical tribes which sought to use
the same waters.</p>

<p>Evidence is presented in the present work that the characters on
rock pictures sometimes were pointers or “sign-posts” to show the
direction of springs, the line of established trails, or of paths that
would shorten distances in travel. It has been supposed that similar
indications were used guiding to burial mounds and other places of
peculiar sanctity or interest, but the evidence of this employment is
not conclusive. Many inquiries have been made of the Bureau of
Ethnology concerning Indian marks supposed to indicate the sites of
gold, silver, and copper mines and buried treasure generally, which
inquiries were answered only because it was recognized as the duty of
an office of the government to respond, so far as possible, to requests
for information, however silly, which are made in good faith.</p>

<p>Petroglyphs are now most frequently found in those parts of the
world which are still, or recently have been, inhabited by savage or
barbarian tribes. Persons of these tribes when questioned about the
authorship of the rock drawings have generally attributed them to
supernatural beings. Statements to this effect from many peoples of
the three Americas and of other regions, together with the names of
rockwriting deities, are abundantly cited in the present work. This is
not surprising, nor is it instructive, except as to the mere fact that the
drawings are ancient. Man has always attributed to supernatural action
whatever he did not understand. Also, it appears that in modern
times shamans have encouraged this belief and taken advantage of it
to interpret for their own purposes the drawings, some of which have
been made by themselves. But notwithstanding these errors and
frauds, a large proportion of the petroglyphs in America are legitimately
connected with the myths and the religious practices of the authors.
The information obtained during late years regarding tribes
such as the Zuñi, Moki, Navajo, and Ojibwa, which have kept up on the
one hand their old religious practices and on the other that of picture
writing, is conclusive on this point. The rites and ceremonies of these
tribes are to some extent shown pictorially on the rocks, some of the
characters on which have until lately been wholly meaningless, but are
now identified as drawings of the paraphernalia used in or as diagrams
of the drama of their rituals. Unless those rituals, with the creeds
and cosmologies connected with them had been learned, the petroglyphs
would never have been interpreted. The fact that they are now
understood does not add any new information, except that perhaps in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page771" id="page771">[771]</a></span>
some instances their age may show the antiquity and continuity of the
present rites.</p>

<p>A potent reason for caution in making deductions based only on
copies of figures published incidentally in works of travel is that it can
seldom be ascertained with exactness what is the true depiction of those
figures as actually existing or as originally made. The personal equation
affects the drawings and paintings intended to be copies from the
rock surfaces and also the engravings and other forms of reproductions,
and the student must rely upon very uncertain reproductions for most
of his material. The more ancient petroglyphs also require the aid of
the imagination to supply eroded lines or faded colors. Travelers and
explorers are seldom so conscientious as to publish an obscure copy of
the obscure original. It is either made to appear distinct or is not
furnished at all, and if the author were conscientious the publisher
would probably overrule him.</p>

<p>Thorough knowledge of the historic tribes, including their sociology,
sophiology, technology, and especially their sign language, will probably
result in the interpretation of many more petroglyphs than are
now understood, but the converse is not true. The rock characters
studied independently will not give much primary information about
customs and concepts, though it may and does corroborate what has
been obtained by other modes of investigation. A knowledge of Indian
customs, costumes, including arrangement of hair, paint, and all
tribal designations, and of their histories and traditions, is essential
to the understanding of their drawings; for which reason some of those
particulars known to have influenced pictography have been set forth
in this work and objects have been mentioned which were known to
have been portrayed graphically with special intent.</p>

<p>Other objects are used symbolically or emblematically which, so far
as known, have never appeared in any form of pictographs, but might
be found in any of them. For instance, Mr. Schoolcraft says of the
Dakotas that “some of the chiefs had the skins of skunks tied to their
heels to symbolize that they never ran, as that animal is noted for its
slow and self-possessed movements.” This is one of the many customs
to be remembered in the attempted interpretations of pictographs. The
present writer does not know that a skunk skin or a strip of skin which
might be supposed to be a skunk skin attached to a human heel has
ever been separately used pictorially as the ideogram of courage or
steadfastness, but with the knowledge of this objective use of the skins,
if they were found so represented pictorially, the interpretation would
be suggested without any direct explanation from Indians.</p>

<p>A partial view of petroglyphs has excited hope that by their correlation
the priscan homes and migrations of peoples may be ascertained.
Undoubtedly striking similarities are found in regions far apart from as
well as near to each other. A glance at the bas-reliefs of Boro Boudour
in Java, now copied and published by the Dutch authorities, at once recalls
figures of the lotus and uræus of Egypt, the horns of Assyria, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page772" id="page772">[772]</a></span>
thunderbolt of Greece, the Buddhist fig tree, and other noted characters
common in several parts of the world. If the petroglyphs of America
are considered as the texts with which all others may be compared, it is
believed that the present work shows illustrations nearly identical with
many much-discussed carvings and paintings on the rocks of the eastern
hemisphere, those in Siberia being most strongly suggestive of
connection. But from the present collection it would seem that the
similarity of styles in various regions is more worthy of study than is
the mere resemblance or even identity of characters, the significance
of which is unknown and may have differed in the intent of the several
authors. Indeed it is clear that even in limited areas of North America,
diverse significance is attached to the same figure and differing
figures are made to express the same concept.</p>

<p>The present work shows a surprising resemblance between the typical
forms among the petroglyphs found in Brazil, Venezuela, Peru,
Guiana, part of Mexico, and those in the Pacific slope of North America.
This similarity includes the forms in Guatemala and Alaska,
which, on account of the material used, are of less assured antiquity.
Indeed it would be safe to include Japan and New Zealand in this general
class. In this connection an important letter from Mr. James G.
Swan, respecting the carved wooden images of the Haidas, accentuates
the deduction derived only from comparison. Mr. Swan says that he
showed to the Indians of various coast tribes the plates of Dr. Habel’s
work on sculptures in Guatemala, and that they all recognized several

the pictures of the Zuñi ceremonials, masks, and masquerades scenes

<p>Without entering upon the discussion whether America was peopled
from east to west, or from either, or from any other part of the earth,
it is for the present enough to suggest that the petroglyphs and other
pictographs in the three Americas indicate that their pre-Columbian
inhabitants had at one time frequent communication with each other,
perhaps not then being separated by the present distances of habitat.
Styles of drawing and painting could thus readily be diffused, and, indeed,
to mention briefly the extralimital influence, if as many Japanese
and Chinese vessels were driven upon the west American coast in
prehistoric times as are known by historic statistics to have been so
driven, the involuntary immigrants skilled in drawing and painting
might readily have impressed their styles upon the Americans near
their landing place to be thence indefinitely diffused. This hypothesis
would not involve migration.</p>

<p>Interest has been felt in petroglyphs, because it has been supposed
that if interpreted they would furnish records of vanished peoples or
races, and connected with that supposition was one naturally affiliated
that the old rock sculptures were made by peoples so far advanced
in culture as to use alphabets or at least syllabaries, thus supporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page773" id="page773">[773]</a></span>
the theory about the mythical mound builders or some other supposititious
race. All suggestions of this nature should at once be abandoned.
The practice of pictography does not belong to civilization
and declines when an alphabet becomes popularly known. Neither is
there the slightest evidence that an alphabet or syllabary was ever
used in pre-Columbian America by the aborigines, though there is
some trace of Runic inscriptions. The fact that the Maya and Aztec
peoples were rapidly approaching to such modes of expressing thought,
and that the Dakota and Ojibwa had well entered upon that line of
evolution, shows that they had proceeded no farther, and it is admitted
that they were favorable representatives of the tribes of the continent
in this branch of art. The theory mentioned requires the assumption,
without a particle of evidence, that the rock sculptures are alphabetic,
and therefore were made by a supposititious and extinct race. Topers
of the mysterious may delight in such dazing infusions of perverted
fancy, but they are repulsive to the sober student.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks apply mainly to rock inscriptions and not to
pictographs on other substances, the discussion and illustration of
which occupy the greater part of the present work. In that division
there is no need of warning against wild theories or uncertain data.
The objects are in hand and their current use as well as their significance
is understood. Their description and illustration by classes is
presented in the above chapters with such detail that further discussion
here would be mere repetition.</p>

<p>One line of thought, however, is so connected with several of the
classifications that it may here be mentioned with the suggestion that
the preceding headings, with the illustrations presented under each, may
be reviewed in reference to the methodical progress of pictography
toward a determined and convenient form of writing. This exhibition
of evolution was arrested by foreign invasion before the indirect signs
of sound had superseded the direct presentments of sight for communication
and record. Traces of it appear throughout the present paper,
but are more intelligently noticed on a second examination than in
cursory reading. In the Winter Counts of Battiste Good there are
many characters where the figure of a human being is connected with
an object, which shows his tribal status or the disease of which he
died, and the characters representing the tribe or disease are purely
determinative.</p>

<p>The discrimination which is made between animals and objects portrayed
simply as such, and as supernatural or mystic, is shown in the
many illustrations of Ojibwa and Zuñi devices, in which the heart is connected
with a line extending to the mouth, and those of the Ojibwa and
the Dakota, where the spirals indicate spirit or wakan. Animals are
often portrayed without such lines, in which cases it is understood that
they are only the animals in natural condition, but with the designations
or determinatives they are intended to be supernatural. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="page774" id="page774">[774]</a></span>
the Ojibwa animals connected with certain ceremonies are represented
as encircled by a belt or baldric, an ornamented baldric of the same
character being used by the participants in the ceremonial chant
dance; so that the baldric around the animal determines that the figure
is that of a supernatural and mystic, not an ordinary, animal.
This is an indication of the start from simple pictography towards an
alphabet by the use of determinatives as was done by the Chinese.</p>

<p>It is not believed that much information of historical value will be
obtained directly from the interpretation of the petroglyphs in America.
The greater part of those already known are simply peckings,
carvings, or paintings connected with their myths or with their every-day
lives. It is, however, probable that others were intended to commemorate
events, but the events, which to their authors were of
moment, would be of little importance as history, if, as is to be expected,
they were selected in the same manner as is done by modern
Indian pictographers. They referred generally to some insignificant
fight or some season of plenty or of famine, or to other circumstances
the interest in which has long ago died away.</p>

<p>The question may properly be asked, why, with such small prospect
of gaining historic information, so much attention has been directed
to the collection and study of petroglyphs. A sufficient answer might
be submitted, that the fact mentioned could not be made evident until
after that collection and study, and that it is of some use to establish
the limits of any particular line of investigation, especially one largely
discussed with mystical inferences to support false hypotheses. But
though the petroglyphs do not and probably never will disclose the
kind of information hoped for by some enthusiasts, they surely are
valuable as marking the steps in one period of human evolution and
in presenting evidence of man’s early practices. Also though the
occurrences interesting to their authors and therefore recorded or
indicated by them are not important as facts of history, they are proper
subjects of examination, simply because in fact they were the chief
objects of interest to their authors, and for that reason become of
ethnologic import. It is not denied that some of the drawings on rocks
were made without special purpose, for mere pastime, but they are of
import even as mere graffiti. The character of the drawings and the
mode of their execution tell something of their makers. If they do
not tell who those authors were, they at least suggest what kind of people
they were as regards art, customs, and sometimes religion. But
there is a broader mode of estimating the quality of known pictographs.
Musicians are eloquent in lauding of the great composers
of songs without words. The ideography, which is the prominent feature
of picture writing, displays both primordially and practically the
higher and purer concept of thoughts without sound.</p>

<p>The experience of the present writer induces him to offer the following
suggestions for the benefit of travelers and other observers who
may meet with petroglyphs which they may desire to copy and describe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page775" id="page775">[775]</a></span></p>

<p>As a small drawing of large rock inscriptions must leave in doubt
the degree of its finish and perhaps the essential objects of its production,
it is requisite, in every instance, to affix the scale of the drawing,
or to give a principal dimension to serve as a guide. A convenient
scale for ordinary petroglyphs is one-sixteenth of actual size. The
copy should be with sufficient detail to show the character of the work.
It is useful to show the lithologic character of the rock or bowlder
used; whether the drawing has been scratched into the face of the rock,
or incised more deeply with a sharp implement, and the depth of
such incision; whether the design is merely outlined, or the whole
body of the figures pecked out, and whether paint has been applied to
the pecked surface, or the design executed with paint only. The composition
of paint should be ascertained when possible. The amount of
weathering or erosion, together with the exposure, or any other feature
bearing on the question of antiquity, might prove important. If
actual colors are not accessible for representation the ordinary heraldic
scheme of colors can be used.</p>

<p>That sketches, even by artists of ability, are not of high value in
accuracy, is shown by the discrepant copies of some of the most carefully
studied pictographs, which discrepancies sometimes leave in
uncertainty the points most needed for interpretation. Sketches, or
still better, photographs are desirable to present a connected and general
view of the characters and the surface upon which they are found.
For accuracy of details “squeezes” should be obtained when practicable.</p>

<p>A simple method of obtaining squeezes of petroglyphs, when the lines
are sufficiently deep to receive an impression, is to take ordinary manilla
paper of loose texture, and to spread the sheet, after being thoroughly
wetted, over the surface, commencing at the top. The top edge may
be temporarily secured by a small streak of starch or flour paste. The
paper is then pressed upon the surface of the rock by means of a soft
bristle brush, so that its texture is gently forced into every depression.
Torn portions of the paper may be supplied by applying small patches
of wet paper until every opening is thoroughly covered. A coating of
ordinary paste, as above mentioned, is now applied to the entire surface,
and a new sheet of paper, similarly softened by water, is laid over
this and pressed down with the brush. This process is continued until
three or four thicknesses of paper have been used. Upon drying, the
entire mold will usually fall off by contraction. The edge at the top,
if previously pasted to the rock, should be cut. The entire sheet can
then be rolled up, or if inconveniently large can be cut in sections and
properly marked for future purposes. This process yields the negative.
To obtain the positive the inner coating of the negative may be
oiled, and the former process renewed upon the cast.</p>

<p>The characters when painted with bright tints and upon a light-colored
surface, may readily be traced upon tracing linen, such as is
employed by topographers. Should the rock be of a dark color, and
the characters indistinct, a simple process is to first follow the characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="page776" id="page776">[776]</a></span>
in outline with colored crayons, red chalk, or dry colors mixed with
water and applied with a brush, after which a piece of muslin is placed
over the surface and pressed so as to receive sufficient coloring matter
to indicate general form and relative position. After these impressions
are touched up, the true position may be obtained by painting
the lines upon the back of the sheet of muslin, or by making a true
tracing of the negative.</p>

<p>An old mode of securing the outline was to clear out the channels of
the intaglios, then, after painting them heavily, to press a sheet of
muslin into the freshly painted depressions. The obvious objection
to this method is the damage to the inscription. Before such treatment,
if the only one practicable, all particulars of the work to be
covered by paint should be carefully recorded.</p>

<p>The locality should be reported with detail of State (or territory),
county, township, and distance and direction from the nearest post-office,
railway station, or country road. In addition the name of any
contiguous stream, hill, bluff, or other remarkable natural feature
should be given. The name of the owner of the land is of temporary
value, as it is liable to frequent changes. The site or station should
be particularly described with reference to its natural characteristics
and geological history. When petroglyphs are in numbers and groups,
their relation to each other to the points of the compass or to topographical
features, should be noted, if possible, by an accurate survey,
otherwise by numeration and sketching.</p>

<p>The following details should be carefully noted: The direction of
the face of the rock; the presence of probable trails and gaps which
may have been used in shortening distances in travel; localities of
mounds and caves, if any, in the vicinity; ancient camping grounds,
indicated by fragments of pottery, flint chips or other refuse; existence
of aboriginal relics, particularly flints which may have been used
in pecking (these may be found at the base of the rocks upon which
petroglyphs occur); the presence of small mortar-holes which may
have served in the preparation of colors.</p>

<p>With reference to pictographs on other objects than rock it is important
to report the material upon which they appear and the implements
ascertained to be used in their execution examples of which are
given in other parts of this work.</p>

<p>With reference to all kinds of pictographs, it should be remembered
that mere descriptions without graphic representations are of little
value. Probable age and origin and traditions relating to them should
be ascertained. Their interpretation by natives of the locality who
themselves make pictographs or who belong to people who have lately
made pictographs is most valuable, especially in reference to such designs
as may be either conventional, religious, or connected with lines
of gesture-signs.</p>

<h2>LIST OF WORKS AND AUTHORS CITED.</h2>


<p>The object of this alphabetical list is to permit convenient reference to authorities
without either deforming the pages of the present work by footnotes or cumbering
the text with more or less abbreviated indications of editions, volumes, and pages, as
well as titles and names, which in some cases would have required many repetitions.
The list is by no means intended as a bibliography of the subject, nor even as a statement
of the printed and MS. works actually studied and consulted by the present
writer in the preparation of his copy. The details and niceties of bibliographic
description are not attempted, the titles being abbreviated, except in a few instances
where they are believed to be of special interest. The purpose is to include only the
works which have been actually quoted or cited in the text, and, indeed, not all of
those, as it was deemed unnecessary to transfer to the list some well-known works
of which there are no confusing numbers of editions. When a publication is cited
in the text but once, sufficient reference is sometimes made at the place of citation.
When it would seem that the reference should be more particular the work is mentioned
in the text, generally by the name of the author, followed by an italic letter
of the alphabet in a parenthesis, which letter is repeated in the same form under
the author’s name in the alphabetical list followed by mention of the edition from
which the citation was taken, the number of the volume when there is more than
one volume of that edition, and the page; also a reference, when needed, to the
illustration reproduced or described.</p>

<p>Example: When the voluminous official publication of Schoolcraft is first quoted
on p. <a href="#page035">35</a>, the reference is to p. 351 of his first volume, and the name “Schoolcraft” is
followed by (<i>a</i>). On turning to that name in the list there appears under it a note of
the work and the letter (<i>a</i>) is followed by “<span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, p. 351.” The references to this author
are so many that all the letters of the alphabet are successively employed&mdash;indeed,
some of them do duty several times, as several references in the text are to the same
page or plate. The references to this single author would therefore have required at
least thirty footnotes, or corresponding words in the text, instead of thirty italic
letters divided between the several places of citation.</p>

<p>The abbreviation and simplicity of the plan is shown where there are many editions
of the work cited. One of the most troublesome for reference of all publications
is that of the Travels, etc., of Lewis and Clarke. The letter (<i>a</i>) after those
names on p. <a href="#page419">419</a>, repeated under the same names in the list, refers to p. 66 of the
edition specified.</p>

<p>When the italic letter in parenthesis precedes the title of a work in the list,
reference is made to that work as a whole without specific quotation. So also
when no such italic letter appears. Occasionally the title and imprint of a magazine
or other continuous publication appears in the list without note of volume
and page. This occurs where the authority is noted elsewhere, generally more than
once, with only curt reference to the serial publication, and is intended to avoid repetition.</p>

<p>The simple scheme is designed, while avoiding bibliographic prolixity, to give
practical assistance to the reader in finding the authorities cited, when desired.
Scientific pretense has sometimes been sacrificed for simplicity and convenience.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
